3,"population and sample were further discussed upon. sample is a good and representative part of the population. sample is used to predict/estimate the population. attributes and operations such as count, mode , median, mean, std. deviation , variance , add, multiply, divide and subtract. different level of measurement were classified on the basis of these attributes and operations. population has parameter(s) while sample has statistic. we estimate parameters on the basis of these statistic. linear data model was discussed upon from the sales vs advt. expenditure . any model can be fitted upon any set of data but it might not be the best fit. even a point can be considered a model although a naive model. as sample size increases the estimation of parameters gets better and better. based on th sample a slr can be fit with the equation y=î²o+î²1 , where î²o is the bias in the data , as the sample size gets closer and closer to the population this bias reduces. bias represents the sum of the effect of all the unknown(unaccounted for) variables. î²o and î²1 are estimates of the population parameters. we can determine confidence intervals around the estimated parameters , the size of the confidence interval depends upon the level of confidence. as the level of confidence increases the confidence interval gets wider and wider. to find the best fit line we equate the sum of squares of errors of data points from the line to 0. we use ei^2 because it does not depend upon the direction gives the euclidean distance rather than the manhattan distance we get in the case of |ei| . upon partial differentiation of the sum of squares of error we get the values of a and b of the equation y=ax + b.
b= mean(y) - a*mean(x) 
a=(mean(xy) - mean(x) * mean(y) )/(mean(xâ²) - (mean(x))â² )
î²o and î²1are point estimates and we need to arrive at the possible interval within which their value lies such that there is a very high chance that î²op and î²1p (i.e the population parameters) will lie within those intervals respectively.",-0.041535947,-0.012450258,-0.077249825,0.050519,0.022100788,0.021681655,0.007121369,0.08885395,0.008811327,0.0239715,0.05306504,0.041976593,0.0062126135,-0.038731545,0.068489976,-0.11703124,0.04411768,-0.002989165,0.017551789,0.02688234,0.030136185,-0.0070924223,-0.020825526,-0.010997673,-0.02974965,-0.050177738,-0.030188886,0.013168305,-0.039512023,-0.026043834,0.060477078,0.037985764,0.084543355,-0.004335374,0.033342592,-0.07136032,-0.006928445,0.099567704,0.04586738,0.060084198,0.03126991,-0.02391816,-0.02287215,-0.0081118755,0.063385434,-0.0276557,0.0051978985,0.073467046,-0.08826715,0.10456562,-0.033977445,0.055141486,0.0103876535,0.008293014,-0.03688643,-0.060736347,-0.046301484,-0.06762338,-0.027590167,0.020989865,-0.037189364,-0.0016525233,-0.021254329,0.014499364,0.030476294,0.03171964,-0.046579286,0.0050193765,-0.018154398,-0.059660893,-0.029572632,0.019523455,-0.093465805,0.07054526,-0.04695007,-0.08592545,0.055897456,0.01105072,0.04030852,0.032575093,0.031183533,0.08008331,-0.09333993,0.019007675,0.011074273,0.012527939,0.019418761,-0.053106163,-0.030664219,-0.02591084,0.038917992,0.07690119,-0.09850513,0.042954784,-0.0065779528,0.029965745,0.0026947788,0.016105698,0.036404572,0.038286813,0.0369429,0.117535554,0.10605973,-0.0046459134,-0.054115996,-0.05694859,-0.026550153,0.0030601951,0.035016026,0.035728823,-0.09543137,0.026801357,-0.08459231,0.028628038,0.09214706,-0.09369857,-0.060420673,-0.021440625,-0.05967204,0.029466894,0.027417181,0.030960534,0.002415735,0.02676379,0.047661178,0.06913669,-0.046879347,6.843162e-33,-0.14895442,-0.019726612,-0.015470821,0.04570927,-0.054278404,-0.004153696,-0.002171726,0.024062209,0.062087074,0.028154187,-0.022688426,-0.05438231,-0.019496076,0.108435936,0.13478827,0.105086885,-0.039296355,0.0551351,-0.059596304,0.058970697,0.015328818,-0.027810216,0.048946958,0.029121617,-0.012615074,-0.0081666475,0.029833924,0.10888072,-0.009730094,-0.006948995,0.066755325,-0.074088514,0.03237402,-0.035747305,-0.037590403,-0.04074965,-0.039546065,-0.03767352,-0.011679817,-0.024733039,-0.045487467,0.067681246,0.1385389,0.06578525,-0.047058553,0.08358544,0.025963938,-0.01516321,-0.020664986,0.08482485,-0.057629917,-0.07106111,-0.048325855,-0.008042447,-0.03135018,0.09778898,-0.07103143,-0.07493454,-0.04448673,0.02059123,-0.12467848,-0.06940175,0.03477954,-0.008469646,0.022728251,0.025320843,0.04814037,-0.06699656,0.012706152,0.017693602,0.041548017,-0.06872377,-0.06768782,0.06103872,0.02303702,-0.005292452,0.056924336,0.022032762,0.018819368,0.040738404,-0.047200456,-0.039644357,-0.007989571,-0.08013211,0.0021823552,0.041091096,0.022927554,-0.05339981,0.073961355,-0.051550813,-0.011088796,0.1016874,-0.13125353,0.008858371,0.0029158832,-7.141588e-33,0.015631633,0.025436359,0.0026943414,0.06653095,-0.04808734,0.038895335,-0.012777859,-0.03374408,-0.0024049345,-0.06406928,-0.0939722,0.035455808,0.103406295,0.052039713,0.032624982,0.08835868,0.05539581,-0.10342805,0.029690208,0.016093593,-0.01713158,0.043064795,0.0044852355,-0.066615775,-0.045625124,0.0074057784,-0.15440086,0.07032831,0.005343711,-0.08989215,0.034050837,-0.036899872,-4.534986e-05,-0.013141322,-0.038351305,0.03774008,0.051388346,0.04719167,-0.012608942,0.06891467,-0.013764095,0.05312778,-0.01194097,-0.054766376,-0.022697244,0.009469623,0.07358865,0.003683799,0.024479501,-0.045371857,-0.012894159,0.018839296,-0.0100712795,0.0062306547,-0.046450537,-0.016884394,-0.006514544,-0.043788753,-0.065355375,-0.022878861,0.0020468617,0.050031047,-0.06863047,0.021397278,-0.09032834,-0.031888478,0.06632701,-0.081368424,-0.02196408,-0.07245774,-0.03611183,-0.05895847,0.019509513,-0.013646726,-0.12064857,-0.08012042,-0.03673835,0.022660693,0.018817075,-0.038013093,-0.04186919,-0.013194305,-0.023802027,-0.043485094,-0.07650516,-0.015168764,0.021885796,-0.029306391,-0.097389325,0.023221066,-0.096955605,0.050909262,-0.05064502,0.00604101,-0.019215321,-7.0427326e-08,-0.0015529067,0.065668054,0.10568624,0.044531714,-0.020541323,-0.04733688,0.031849463,0.05025607,-0.017519945,0.05986422,0.019967869,0.029043466,-0.06903539,0.060672294,0.0072303927,0.06406701,0.03664302,0.06392542,-0.03775061,0.013923218,0.057080295,0.012609136,-0.03293819,0.019468034,0.117815875,-0.054069478,-0.000844368,0.054658365,-0.012869013,0.003996485,-0.0009710808,-0.008314554,0.028951425,-0.016121738,0.099230416,-0.03942614,-0.028542988,-0.09188751,0.031096602,0.0028923089,0.025207672,0.059388936,-0.039391134,0.018162811,0.053954173,-0.03035144,0.0036476953,-0.0837475,0.016479075,0.034655184,0.016689876,-0.03765953,-0.023729123,-0.031068016,-0.035880297,0.027165644,-0.016234165,0.0027481248,-0.033577662,0.03733786,0.053747676,-0.00042750538,-0.030202353,-0.025399778,0,-28.462875,-11.276878,12
6,"the lecture explained how we use samples to understand populations. a sample is a small group taken from a population that should represent it well. this lets us study the sample to estimate the population's parameters. these estimates, calculated from the sample, are called statistics.
we then discussed regression. a good model takes the data from the sample to find a slope and an intercept of a regression line. these are our best estimates of the true values for the population. however, point estimates aren't very accurate. they're good, but they're not great. so to make our estimation more reliable, we form an interval estimate that allows us to say something like, ""we are 95% confident that the true value lies in this range.""
points estimates are different for different samples and better if sample becomes larger.
we then considered how to determine the best-fit line. among the methods available, such as minimizing the sum of errors or mod of errors , these were not the best approaches. instead, we opted to minimize the sum of squared errors, which yields better results because it reduces the effect of larger errors by magnifying them.
finally, we found a direct formula to compute the slope and intercept. it is known as closed form since we do not require iteration.",-0.074764796,0.03698172,0.013795401,0.08331923,0.017992996,0.040961154,-0.013889065,0.08792118,0.05910763,0.032372538,-0.0017996172,-0.024737101,0.036473222,-0.07814293,0.002194372,-0.04588419,0.00246436,-0.045304824,-0.0034933672,-0.012053296,0.01597995,0.009930357,0.030294275,0.053610094,-0.027567456,-0.010988139,-0.006340502,-0.011265658,0.00036160395,0.02252658,-0.008356841,0.059970893,0.037087306,-0.05931231,-0.024792852,0.026907219,-0.06030446,0.05351938,0.037588213,0.039905317,-0.01712416,0.00012854405,0.019669589,0.095799185,0.05023143,-0.006146745,0.0025183025,0.006018947,-0.052851398,0.08990098,-0.083710335,0.0859519,0.029478729,-0.08451084,-0.010654122,-0.074310355,-0.050449487,-0.08877439,0.024280446,-0.014300612,0.03987609,-0.032752644,-0.055640712,0.009694117,0.03171894,-0.039230157,-0.0021607573,-0.05815245,0.049511936,-0.0108285565,-0.055901077,0.03852857,-0.06722871,0.10881102,0.0057211486,-0.09055629,-0.014715257,-0.0064210044,0.041969135,0.0047683897,0.08154202,-0.025478909,-0.015130885,0.027686998,0.04636473,-0.016917247,0.03554885,0.01976703,-0.015145851,-0.01635687,0.050703645,0.067009546,-0.100572124,0.11512996,0.06096504,0.033028245,0.005841713,-0.026351137,0.10522371,0.042250253,0.046557356,0.05388386,-0.010396349,-0.11318618,-0.022525424,-0.10573763,0.024224017,0.003275268,0.011469069,0.0464405,-0.017312177,-0.07736757,-0.03243274,0.082088806,0.117200844,-0.09730981,0.0020446826,0.013525003,-0.009688857,0.023473678,0.007999496,0.03526368,0.036429286,0.04747349,0.014999115,0.07930263,-0.031214513,1.0461897e-33,-0.013267438,-0.02089779,0.044447053,0.053242594,-0.041245386,-0.021871038,-0.13337167,-0.008304942,0.031034214,0.11695837,-0.02080851,-0.06477527,0.029573703,-0.0165362,0.12667753,0.05180818,-0.020403923,0.07709199,-0.071366824,0.05379757,0.04213018,-0.06807153,0.099507205,-0.04854436,0.015618458,0.064928405,0.016013218,0.09228875,-0.020747101,-0.019009033,0.017401597,-0.037742957,0.026210971,-0.06349569,-0.013146056,-0.023771822,0.031718146,-0.025543721,-0.04908098,0.015347781,0.019834923,0.097493,0.10668016,0.049357265,0.079853386,-0.030643258,-0.027311828,-0.015513145,-0.044913605,0.1097047,-0.09042378,0.011319141,-0.03259078,-0.034602974,-0.043142155,0.10814373,-0.09199437,-0.020482752,-0.077716045,-0.009008565,0.032280862,-0.003612991,-0.029346973,-0.06395604,2.2555683e-05,0.042741615,-0.047371384,-0.0019412255,0.020486759,0.03773621,0.036931917,-0.045840852,-0.08488198,-0.0013427165,-0.0554789,-0.068642706,0.037697703,0.078551784,0.07868911,-0.054629374,0.07198132,-0.0329317,-0.12566507,-0.09687809,-0.01823527,-0.04743594,0.032307733,0.040672056,0.019756995,-0.047480702,-0.04904985,-0.03279033,-0.091076605,0.027569532,-0.06541243,-2.7465255e-33,-0.03581081,0.032832745,-0.0119891185,0.03334668,-0.048705928,-0.047195166,-0.021296063,-0.08062476,0.06803779,-0.0799336,-0.08222165,0.04570287,0.11196794,0.050848316,0.016269838,-0.015558509,0.06703512,-0.09130446,-0.0045381207,-0.072877996,-0.0072533432,-0.04039281,-0.015451465,-0.04298719,-0.029871976,0.030165527,-0.15270476,-0.024455013,-0.0010400468,-0.09336794,0.04594382,-0.09955532,-0.012336995,-0.024186378,-0.011306533,0.046920378,0.024876595,0.0031434293,-0.008291522,0.026415106,0.03055636,-0.0114579825,-0.013067211,-0.12215129,0.02097005,0.101331055,0.038711213,-0.0012826932,-0.056836314,0.014673914,0.012111258,0.016726647,-0.04030369,0.062295735,-0.022451125,-0.02549087,-0.051066164,-0.023730332,0.0016288882,-0.0059107905,0.008057813,0.027185675,-0.11119943,0.12942217,-0.017891983,0.048156973,-0.022161065,0.016211193,-0.0025931585,0.011215734,-0.07173578,-0.058224663,0.010614327,-0.019730698,-0.04124901,-0.023308614,-0.026143868,-0.0045263576,0.018142456,-0.048110332,0.050926737,-0.019162426,0.040690903,0.015633997,-0.024153382,-0.0007913535,0.03131594,0.00088060857,-0.047769126,0.051610462,-0.047669332,0.007944835,-0.10072483,-0.073576204,-0.025941616,-7.149447e-08,-0.10089323,0.0541895,0.019285953,0.017450498,0.036805727,0.006565442,-0.039003834,-0.030902933,0.011246389,0.0045620636,0.024010941,-0.007342615,-0.05470084,0.0023803215,0.062590055,0.06770741,0.027083142,0.072792664,0.023972096,0.026317876,-0.057294317,0.011263078,-0.06739551,-0.052767407,0.09708517,0.05050866,0.0069973115,0.08092677,-0.03810413,-0.024703292,0.002988446,0.029859295,0.057035774,0.050642487,0.07665337,0.01471184,-0.039560683,0.030059049,0.044789396,-0.008840943,-0.039951358,0.056359857,-0.027897036,0.018448569,0.09128318,-0.0057780407,0.03645198,0.06592229,-0.055582304,-0.0028527656,-0.01675041,-0.018819084,-0.045941852,0.018395027,-0.014340211,0.0050183265,-0.042403635,-0.014340064,0.0011958176,0.009920971,0.011813197,0.04614891,-0.084950246,-0.04225413,0,-25.00007,-5.8189173,12
20," a sample is just a smaller group taken from a larger population. any calculations we make from a sample, like averages, variances, or standard deviations, are called statistics, while the same calculations done on the entire population are known as parameters. the goal is often to estimate these population parameters using statistics from a sample.
now, in the case of simple linear regression, weâ€™re trying to find a straight line that best fits our data so we can predict one thing based on another. the equation of this line is written as: 
y = î²â‚€ +  î²â‚x 
where:
y is the predicted value,
x is the input value, and
î²â‚€ and î²â‚ are the parameters of the line.
these parameters, î²â‚€ and î²â‚, represent the intercept and the slope of the line, and they're estimates of the population parameters. to get the best estimates for these, we want to minimize the errorsâ€”basically, the difference between the actual data points and the line we're drawing.
we do this by minimizing the sum of squared errors which are just the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. it's a way to avoid problems that would arise from just using raw differences (like positive and negative errors canceling each other out). minimizing these squared differences gives us the best-fit line.
to find the actual values of î²â‚€ and î²â‚, we use a method called partial differentiation to minimize the errors. the formulas that come out of this are:
î²â‚€ = mean(y) - î²â‚ * mean(x)
î²â‚ = (mean(xy) - mean(x) * mean(y)) / (mean(xâ²) - mean(x)â²)
these give us the estimated values of the slope and intercept, which help us understand the relationship between the variables in our data. by using these estimates, we can get a good approximation of the population parameters and make predictions from our model.",-0.093242384,0.057217825,-0.0036281869,0.10810172,0.05672838,0.03640057,-0.015287693,0.07856704,0.033400066,0.039678745,-0.00041878188,0.011394197,0.051960606,-0.039019585,-0.044400595,0.010896426,-0.020361817,0.004649837,-0.04234557,0.0026379204,0.061233625,-0.02340889,-0.08817681,0.03608861,-0.010080041,0.029272974,-0.007797984,0.01332223,-0.00051837234,-0.006223893,0.028248057,0.033638604,0.05665657,-0.022958482,-0.021296853,-0.014144834,0.023066767,0.061405577,0.0072918837,0.0054532695,0.01977206,-0.0181781,-0.021464309,0.06342096,0.034401495,0.0063836374,0.012633585,-0.044985455,-0.05149103,0.09382577,-0.003388689,0.012986617,-0.024375428,-0.045994263,0.036736146,-0.07826432,-0.014984603,0.021402048,0.0873947,0.027799346,0.048757713,-0.07733846,0.020628043,0.017332617,0.016115317,-0.0792971,0.024388155,0.015104443,-0.0139201535,0.0015225331,-0.06413346,0.033279795,-0.07322299,0.036099967,0.069759585,-0.0891215,0.029471189,0.011406816,0.020941848,0.041570485,0.02821281,0.012774185,0.003060471,-0.0027596287,-0.015840674,0.045530632,-0.021297026,-0.103259325,0.09576442,-0.033356268,0.0019601374,0.02033363,-0.06766353,0.112257935,0.029425604,0.0036999725,0.045375515,-0.020559074,0.038399134,0.041996375,0.055676565,0.056369,0.052057516,0.00015419918,-0.0029723726,-0.08261854,0.06451508,-0.08853221,-0.0035687601,-0.00026999853,-0.034197874,-0.06426236,-0.037752815,0.04758442,0.022427598,-0.09329084,0.031112816,0.015212988,-0.0058724442,0.0013271531,-0.04548153,0.032855965,-0.014076601,0.03803963,0.07251503,0.07607208,-0.04091907,2.8446012e-33,-0.019621229,0.026349217,0.012065921,0.033319138,-0.018019564,-0.07675346,-0.07690422,-0.040097915,0.048468094,0.111073576,0.00580113,-0.17694321,0.02829972,0.11469057,0.08113468,0.048943717,-0.022335647,-0.016125197,-0.03655944,0.048101842,-0.07015675,-0.0023880384,0.07969897,-0.051645085,-0.0431173,0.025260782,0.043256637,0.071699284,-0.025341578,-0.018862657,0.0023761152,-0.007022613,0.02261354,-0.0753115,0.021077171,-0.036009774,0.11238695,-0.072867215,-0.008047991,0.0779589,0.026628254,0.08859228,0.10002017,0.0037114623,0.061171662,-0.016752837,-0.036247443,0.053328887,0.013206942,0.051133487,-0.11375491,0.0077150115,-0.008004103,0.052215893,0.037838943,0.07706793,-0.08186046,-0.061727073,-0.040152702,0.02806611,-0.048604306,-0.036975093,-0.01746242,0.0055433726,0.07072986,0.058257695,0.04144583,0.036288965,0.044801686,-0.035010558,-0.039373953,-0.06600352,-0.017368052,0.007618935,0.053154025,-0.07747756,0.046062265,0.039307375,0.032682016,-0.05952877,-0.004708664,0.07119657,-0.09684392,-0.12255788,-0.07412197,-0.06421634,0.030503089,-0.06906659,-0.016911307,-0.039223287,-0.073255934,0.023849389,-0.10444287,0.04327482,-0.006660454,-5.8931055e-33,-0.009004085,0.04896138,0.0099738855,-0.018557299,-0.027378805,-0.04825578,-0.0005745488,-0.07987347,0.048971478,-0.016503617,-0.08213191,-0.004560989,0.013053275,0.038330954,0.039046485,0.061097573,-0.017021947,-0.066183224,-0.027540123,-0.08978769,0.023874331,-0.04893943,0.06103521,-0.029373368,-0.066888064,-0.0019996779,-0.063677736,0.03920326,0.003514562,-0.106244974,-0.01244762,-0.03172534,-0.09077192,-0.08670811,-0.06924195,0.07552598,-0.035853915,0.05703477,-0.013942814,-0.012409194,-0.008267734,0.033024907,0.025707854,-0.15670587,-0.017850377,0.07425058,0.015126796,-0.032703225,-0.017059585,-0.04004937,-0.0027916536,0.074427396,-0.057147715,0.082600325,-0.0444014,-0.09020601,-0.08751942,0.035903018,0.010468798,0.021111075,0.035763703,-0.022197424,-0.16090584,0.055847764,-0.08524601,0.03223433,-0.007996506,-0.05453521,0.06885469,0.022911178,-0.027678635,-0.061435178,0.031789955,0.026903968,-0.034029786,-0.079184994,-0.028491179,-0.047774408,0.0031837013,-0.020478107,0.053263955,-0.0010754471,0.06629852,-0.05622788,-0.017101072,-0.024089178,0.0111996,0.088209994,-0.024810396,-0.007392641,-0.0057038497,-0.016514266,-0.025138456,0.02240113,0.0071768765,-6.626899e-08,-0.10601314,0.000493387,0.020764235,-0.03947883,-0.028862786,-0.02218832,0.00028256958,-0.01608233,0.0026824982,-0.0061866143,0.011786136,0.054930903,-0.04512794,-0.0173566,0.025155433,0.12970352,-0.027420523,0.017502414,0.03219443,0.038680576,-0.04087023,-0.066164255,-0.09537084,-0.036981884,0.08484894,-0.019934993,0.07886805,0.1368695,-0.026176885,0.02651091,-0.011179482,0.029825956,0.056573484,0.004055907,0.033330087,-0.021583479,-0.0051041176,-0.043521978,-0.0021608404,-0.05362829,-0.023135245,0.056692548,-0.035854645,-0.04867141,0.03962674,0.0068741133,0.062906206,-0.0094129555,-0.0080441125,-0.07343832,0.039554816,-0.06831465,-0.0019064234,0.016034702,-0.05486362,-0.031438317,-0.053079944,0.027399395,0.003493241,-0.0057508564,0.012472011,0.09588296,0.019710835,-0.08397546,0,-23.933613,-9.475541,12
36,"sample should be good and representative
statistic: attribute calculated for sample
parameter: attribute estimated for population

simple linear regression:
only one predictor variable (x)
assume linear model y = (a * x) + b
where b is the inherent bias; accommodates the effect of all the unknown variables

how to assess if the values of a and b are good (the model is a good fit or not) ?
prediction using model = yhat
error = y - yhat
size of dataset : n (n samples indexed i = 1 to n)
sum of squared error = sum_{i = 1 to n} [(y - yhat) ^ 2]
closed form solution is known but we have zero confidence in how well they estimate the true values of a and b for the population.

38,"from today's class i learned about the difference between sample and population data and how they are related and how we use various sample dataset to estimate the information about population and to estimate with some level of confidence we introduce the concept of confidence intervals. then we moved on to simple linear regression where i understand the least squares error and based on that we minimise it with respect to weights to get the best fit line. but there can be different best fit line depending upon sample dala and the mean of sample will always lie on the best fit line with least squares error . then we derive the values of a,b(weights) in case of simple linear regression but if there are multiple features then the calculation of wegaireh by directly doing differentiation and minimising it can be very difficult so we will look for some kind of algorithms in next class.

42,"we are trying to fit y = f(x)
y is dependent variable
x is independent variable

in simple linear regression, y = bâ° + bâ¹x
bâ° and bâ¹ are estimates of population parameters 
as sample size increase, prediction error will decrease, the statistics will get better 

ei = (yi - yi')
ei is point error
total error is accumulation of point errors
if e = sum(ei), positive and negative will cancel, hence can not be used. if e = sum(|ei|), sphere of influence is diamond shaped. if e = sum(eiâ²), sphere of influence is circular. 

for simple linear regression, we have closed form solution.",0.00857071,0.040922433,0.081806675,0.06267962,0.066148415,0.044578113,0.0039893757,0.027131937,0.022006733,0.05593315,0.09472857,0.009100178,0.08948252,-0.0009623059,0.01718053,0.01405202,-0.022894293,-0.03865444,-0.0566553,-0.01577013,0.029440885,-0.06299998,-0.051762715,0.053891275,-0.06250506,0.044544786,0.04615998,-0.029974218,-0.017153993,-0.052146107,0.020461582,0.04722521,-0.009404688,-0.04934747,-0.06605256,-0.040920887,-0.07130796,0.04245236,0.01941573,0.0024370782,0.040211923,0.058613095,0.10659042,0.07343005,0.02844471,-0.051348884,-0.0034847003,0.03915511,-0.0199277,-0.007995752,0.0060072253,-0.06694617,-0.00085657975,-0.08893311,0.12722948,-0.13523372,-0.03683178,0.035253983,0.06781609,0.022336503,0.08597116,-0.013268615,0.020052597,-0.040103957,0.023456367,-0.033897154,0.014675855,-0.032290593,-0.14010356,0.019357402,0.005444701,-0.039197028,-0.10101936,-0.043743778,0.05993595,-0.013094724,-0.0043991646,0.08237621,-0.036226366,0.095149495,-0.014962256,0.027885314,0.023357281,0.009578967,-0.045791175,0.018230263,-0.034424063,-0.03906634,0.027914293,0.039354198,0.029402886,0.0123342145,-0.06697013,0.0036063544,-0.0003662757,-0.070662096,-0.0465614,0.009128611,-0.0101697,0.023375439,-6.4411455e-05,0.087170385,0.004161782,0.07196808,-0.0015249348,-0.008331312,0.07738621,0.01943269,0.012846074,0.07242727,-0.09241758,-0.06198132,-0.03439131,0.024769122,0.011696671,-0.068427384,-0.016901445,0.036714677,-0.039962817,-0.05228556,0.061115332,-0.019229893,-0.05368869,0.068775415,-0.06639702,0.038916208,-0.10180463,1.04590734e-32,-0.05793066,0.062002346,-0.0028118477,0.03310511,-0.014324115,-0.032308448,-0.06299275,0.017502949,0.03708693,-0.015720697,-0.07367198,-0.07886459,-0.016862374,-0.031476688,0.07252537,0.035364807,0.08082845,0.035883367,-0.10009193,0.03284999,-0.01642805,-0.0731591,-0.0017753785,-0.08610531,-0.01759007,-0.0037342126,0.016416524,0.020242408,-0.019443702,-0.024220444,0.15131108,-0.057049748,0.031453438,-0.04737923,-0.02093004,-0.054255273,-0.035202824,0.023983762,-0.060956072,0.015741166,0.03598881,0.11174773,0.036232635,0.02008236,0.04428714,0.02320949,-0.041781183,0.030928357,0.0050331894,0.014547016,-0.076296665,0.0031642064,-0.065555006,-0.016062176,0.038337097,0.09015434,-0.10146695,-0.018952807,-0.026008269,-0.059164003,-0.0009693496,-0.01345544,-0.0108969975,-0.06089853,0.10213693,0.06718076,0.00840207,-0.08071796,0.0220761,-0.033102117,0.03419278,0.06371591,0.002135095,0.027682308,0.021925425,-0.07436351,-0.040535737,-0.066923276,0.06583627,-0.034571197,-0.04950382,-0.0027540415,-0.04108315,-0.07401664,-0.007175596,-0.04894947,0.01584478,0.03418441,-0.057103615,-0.002689548,0.021740703,-0.007148417,-0.07119781,0.08928205,-0.03334814,-9.6174606e-33,-0.037171774,0.011418584,0.05460545,-0.07664424,0.044185665,0.02165605,0.01594488,-0.00990507,0.059089627,-0.015488653,-0.0918386,-0.03983839,0.051466867,0.07279652,0.05457765,0.056523185,0.014353501,-0.03570294,-0.06219154,0.04955162,-0.035276134,0.019038744,0.06721172,-0.015436598,-0.06495408,0.003298294,-0.122049406,0.12095971,-0.08205027,0.03593329,-0.054514293,-0.006949914,-0.0375702,-0.059813153,-0.06803227,0.04836354,-0.052795038,-0.022776745,-0.03557385,-0.03730511,-0.006320702,0.003236358,-0.010832068,-0.11076379,0.039033342,0.045817446,0.08972322,0.030906443,0.012137168,0.0006325512,-0.047928136,0.007184842,-0.01710011,0.0993057,-0.035718765,0.053967156,-0.024970783,0.082627535,0.03302008,-0.06510592,-0.074914165,0.0013874655,-0.04125501,0.062819354,-0.02977053,0.07270362,0.0070468923,0.03052797,0.066085376,-0.029408578,-0.06757999,-0.0066149663,0.046449482,0.048189703,0.030786537,-0.057456344,-0.024626961,-0.074584514,-0.0026761587,0.03690111,0.009605421,0.08884334,0.031616405,-0.051882345,0.030685376,-0.011416711,0.042920973,0.013236442,-0.0773403,0.03904491,-0.05868909,0.04092994,0.04111336,-0.028308764,0.08598434,-6.1210244e-08,-0.07075102,0.001715105,0.02203388,0.0989155,-0.00048211656,-0.0828861,0.068610795,-0.024173655,-0.020492854,0.0069252923,-0.11067037,0.0404644,0.0036807812,0.011295084,-0.043583825,0.036101572,-0.0020724242,0.059522405,0.02626175,-0.00668515,0.020297999,-0.07972801,-0.01056717,-0.039219916,0.048359547,-0.071835905,-0.00081380585,0.0036110634,-0.06067498,0.041256007,0.0012390525,0.039390985,0.021027986,0.048358336,-0.021959769,-0.015047754,0.018282847,-0.0049161226,0.004731576,0.07751788,0.011863195,0.08432731,0.02097051,-0.03076993,0.10377683,0.086528,0.07666449,-0.08695699,-0.044344753,-0.10490106,0.07782409,-0.027990293,-0.0050615678,-0.0047711534,0.037134774,0.010674473,-0.01781058,0.07598927,0.00010679162,0.028775891,-0.0175902,-0.017946674,0.011525885,-0.112423465,0,-22.034157,-10.635664,12
43,"we began by discussing the quality of the sample and stressing the importance of its representativeness to the population for reliable analysis. a distinction was made between statistics (which are calculated on samples) and parameters (which are estimated on populations). key measures related to the mean, such as count, mode, standard deviation, median, were introduced. next, we turn to the concept of simple linear regression (slr), discussing how it establishes relationships between variables. an interesting point is made regarding the lack of fit of individual data points, as class representativeness summarizes the diversity of a class. the concept of bias in slr is introduced, emphasizing how it reflects the influence of other factors on the output variable

53,"population and sample differ in that a sample is a subset of the population. attributes calculated for a sample are called statistics, while those for a population are called parameters. parameters can be estimated using sample statistics (e.g., mean, variance, standard deviation).

in simple linear regression, the goal is to find the best-fit line (y = î²â‚€ + î²â‚x) for making predictions. here, î²â‚€ and î²â‚ are estimates of population parameters. confidence intervals for these estimates are calculated by minimizing the sum of squared errors (î£(eáµ¢â²), where eáµ¢ = yáµ¢ - (î²â‚€ + î²â‚xáµ¢)).

the estimates for î²â‚€ and î²â‚ are derived as:

58,"analyzing the entire population to understand its behavior/characteristics is not feasible both â€“ time wise and money wise. so, we make use of (representative) samples.

attributes
attributes associated with samples as well as population are:
1.	count (frequency)
2.	mode
3.	mean
4.	standard deviation
5.	variance, and many others
operations
operations associated with samples as well as population are:
1.	count
2.	add
3.	subtract
4.	multiply
5.	divide and many others

using a sample, we can estimate the mean of the population.
attributes associated with the population are known as parameters while those associated with the sample as statistics.
we want to estimate the parameters based on the statistics.

simple linear regression has only one predictor.

y is the response variable/dependent variable/label
x is the predictor variable/independent variable/feature

on a scatter plot in which it looked like the points were scattered on the surface of a circular disc. then he pointed out a few things, which are:
1.	simple linear regression is not required in such cases.
2.	it would not be the best possible method in such cases.
3.	but if someone wants to apply it, then it can be applied.
4.	in such a case a point is a better approximation than a line, this can be understood by taking any value of the feature (x) and then by looking at the difference in its actual value at that x and the predicted value.
5.	each point can be considered as a model â€“ although a very naã¯ve one.

bias - value of the y â€“ intercept in the equation obtained by simple linear regression.

as the size of the sample which we are using to estimate the population parameters increases the estimates become better.

estimation interval or confidence interval, finding î²0 and î²1 was just the start of machine learning. we need to take into account the error that would be there in our estimation. we have no basis to say that î²0 = î²0p.

confidence interval which is that with a% probability we can say that the parameter value will lie in an interval, that interval is known as confidence interval. typically, confidence intervals are of 90% or 95% and sometimes even 99%. 100% confidence interval is the interval from -infinity to +infinity.

options : 
1.	minimize sum of all ei
2.	minimize the sum of squares of all ei.
3.	minimize the sum of perpendicular distance between all pairs of {(xi,,yi) and (xi,yi-bar)}.
4.	minimize the sum of absolute value of all ei.
here ei = yi â€“ (yi-bar)

59,"in this lecture we first learned about population and that sample should be good and representative. our goal is to predict or estimate population from sample and we can use operations like counting ,adding ,subtracting, multiplication and division. also, we have attributes like frequency or count, mode ,median ,mean, standard deviation ,variance if we estimate for population then it is called parameter and if we calculate for sample then it is called statistic. we want to estimate the parameters based on the statistics. we create a model based on how correctly can we predict the values based on that model. even a point can be considered as a model but it will be a very naive model. first we need to perform some operation on the data points like plotting scatter plot or something and from which we can see and conclude that whether we have to use simple linear regression or we have to just create a single point as a model. for a particular model bias represents the net sum of all unaccountable variables. one set of samples will give one line but some other samples might give other line so we just create one of the very possible models. we need to estimate the confidence interval for values of b0 and b1. the best way to arrive at these values is by using sum of square of errors because it will magnify the error. the mean of the observation lies on the prediction line .we have closed form solution to calculate the values of a and b. b0 and b1r point estimates and we need to arrive at the possible interval within which these values will lie such that

80,"i learned about the concepts of population and sample, where analyzing an entire population is often impractical, so we work with samples to estimate population parameters. using attributes like mean, median, variance, and more, we study data to uncover patterns.

for instance, in simple linear regression, a single predictor is used to predict sales, like advertisement expenditure, using the equation y = bâ‚€ + bâ‚x. here, bâ‚€ (intercept) and bâ‚ (slope) are sample-based estimates of population parameters. our aim is to find a confidence interval for these estimates to claim where the true population values likely lie.

the intercept, bâ‚€ accounts for other factors (bias), which decreases as we add more predictors. in minimizing the sum of squared errors, we compute bâ‚€ and bâ‚, and curiously, the means of the predictor and response values always lie on the best-fit line.",-0.079362355,0.049392175,0.024031827,0.14241683,0.06228813,0.059792433,-0.016498493,0.033218857,0.008402479,-0.0243878,0.028129183,-0.06410778,0.046929646,-0.0570294,0.024473274,-0.037780095,0.015018201,0.031871937,0.018906858,-0.041015822,-0.003725977,-0.0020708432,0.00739098,0.04244963,-0.02610917,-0.06287673,-0.0020182615,0.0017701212,-0.043416936,0.01622564,0.033579506,0.09907118,0.05945775,-0.04670389,-0.001660592,-0.036783557,0.005861965,0.13422793,-0.00094184355,-0.010465219,0.01723303,0.02063775,0.08830384,0.08199016,0.031182699,-0.0069730585,0.13286425,0.0016228103,-0.069397084,0.07287914,-0.04324247,0.06473782,-0.015586799,-0.030231636,-0.026620308,-0.13236201,-0.040109254,-0.0015786603,0.08193289,0.06878357,-0.028540308,-0.014865055,0.02230352,-0.014941578,0.01316956,0.08606773,0.003925009,0.017666364,-0.05161979,0.05231044,-0.03766087,-0.025275063,-0.14426583,0.054678213,0.050499756,-0.024517888,0.025311675,0.005705255,-0.012557209,0.039568946,-0.0184823,-0.01412824,-0.05394842,0.013299699,-0.0051896516,-0.00721112,0.011439936,-0.05381155,0.025292912,-0.013321396,0.056812633,-0.0002734693,-0.032658868,0.06796018,0.016422464,0.03521226,-0.03219714,-0.07737042,0.070429936,0.03636544,-0.02112627,0.019900559,0.09579691,0.008958005,-0.033670187,-0.10743454,0.07383782,-0.022504285,-0.0076150475,0.0056576133,0.009489344,-0.009232192,-0.0100636855,0.058920998,0.14209203,-0.11613791,0.013740423,0.015772693,0.004047092,-0.02961038,0.0130172325,0.05595671,0.06967429,0.029727215,0.0059781848,0.03597906,-0.12424708,4.940331e-33,-0.0104732625,-0.007171621,0.057671722,0.086886756,-0.09152186,-0.055797942,-0.050574463,-0.03560373,0.08054224,0.09191407,0.013031753,-0.09702944,-0.02707513,0.06843627,0.093103595,0.06328,-0.0396573,0.027376316,-0.052188974,0.041670714,-0.020412836,-0.027346302,0.030472621,-0.009834608,-0.0021684,0.041515023,0.038241006,0.06873548,-0.0068981303,0.01093558,0.04579487,-6.22253e-05,0.028064989,-0.040464513,-0.035237234,0.00899805,0.022635454,0.012784494,-0.023407297,0.07748988,-0.04068096,0.061999332,0.085542485,0.03750046,0.06550933,-0.06658259,-0.0072582746,0.03376853,-0.029790206,0.038465302,-0.09798784,0.015367184,-0.023796892,0.017994953,-0.0050069243,0.08914735,-0.065667406,0.00918634,-0.0640627,-0.008586559,-0.032263707,-0.0687016,0.0066188476,-0.050860662,0.0547995,0.07346248,-0.015464335,-0.012932191,0.00028324442,0.0041884226,0.030309951,-0.029730324,-0.07135277,-0.00072928844,-0.007594991,-0.023914443,0.048992112,0.02504579,0.04299732,-0.03060471,0.022968784,-0.0035914164,-0.10416217,-0.07205954,-0.026309645,-0.004119562,0.0687264,-0.08872851,0.00549197,-0.03853664,-0.019872075,-0.00041650468,-0.069880486,0.039752997,-0.07859647,-4.6557673e-33,0.007926346,-0.029739453,0.080523945,-0.0051500476,-0.06601844,-0.06807074,0.07825507,-0.03652388,0.039945204,-0.08886388,-0.12555033,-0.050589744,0.054647356,0.047610156,0.04211089,0.053053264,0.07055166,-0.07515702,0.019972248,-0.040921237,-0.038593,-0.02713212,0.052182816,-0.040632576,-0.08220236,0.005877947,-0.049652126,0.09801693,-0.060916856,-0.09628848,-0.061007965,-0.05124139,-0.03756604,-0.0909736,-0.0621018,0.06726158,-0.0132995,0.05249188,-0.07620007,-0.024825463,0.0026389763,0.031245438,-0.05969213,-0.08739345,-0.005865248,0.036695715,0.05601964,-0.0047107185,0.008227036,-0.015717564,-0.001501785,0.019586809,-0.04544795,0.045525726,-0.06575807,-0.041348495,0.005754789,-0.0021000039,0.04742953,0.026908647,-0.02794162,-0.0068316055,-0.09720706,0.04489934,-0.081118695,-0.00032489013,0.031036956,-0.04068105,0.023964487,-0.036185227,0.032860804,-0.087144524,0.04124909,-0.045876484,-0.08552916,0.01396021,-0.031759925,0.008447816,0.005134449,0.001496315,0.013681425,-0.037360918,0.048769087,-0.07524173,-0.024099275,-0.019371398,-0.007880799,0.065666325,0.0139403045,-0.009575233,-0.13233745,-0.031799007,-0.021202551,-0.075461596,-0.029168602,-6.621967e-08,-0.09594466,0.05663065,0.028469577,-0.0059403214,0.024026377,0.019149493,-0.003718083,0.0041125156,-0.010849832,-0.017322527,0.039371725,0.06279224,-0.03941341,-0.014775379,0.01816408,0.1282527,0.010013417,0.056706585,0.01813712,0.024835488,-0.0048912102,-0.022847341,-0.07114201,-0.059120774,0.08461967,-0.020531757,0.011943213,0.117365316,0.020645138,0.0975509,-0.03465423,-0.040768787,0.062464714,-0.031733423,0.09168056,-0.00069311715,-0.0066310144,-0.051602878,0.036346275,-0.045106295,0.006245888,0.03102785,-0.037726663,-0.004343904,0.11609174,-0.014534265,0.043438356,0.07055953,0.009732634,-0.050160334,0.013082811,-0.09354205,-0.011681772,0.08144989,0.007317642,-0.010525627,0.0028930134,0.04322757,-0.0010395967,0.008421192,0.050318234,0.046720993,0.01174666,-0.050224796,0,-25.870914,-7.9186735,12
112,"lecture started with population and sample definitions. the population being a very large data set cannot be used for all operations and inference derivation hence a smaller representative data set, a sample  is selected. descriptive and detailed statistics are conducted on sample and the inferences are held to be accurate for the entire population set.
line and point models were seen. simple regression model examples were studied - y = b0 + b1x. here x is called the predictor and b0 and b1 the parameters of the regression model. confidence interval can be found by minimising the b0 term often known as bias. the best fit line is where the mean of the response and predictor values is located and the sum of the squares of the errors is minimised to reduce the error.",-0.026391745,0.06798568,-0.01826221,0.08762583,-0.0062213778,0.05095955,-0.033981122,0.08469734,0.027963297,0.042956617,0.043945152,0.03108821,0.09209168,-0.08819199,-0.021238413,-0.020394905,0.020172648,-0.07296605,-0.015151868,-0.049190633,0.0145917805,0.051323183,-0.045643803,0.04826651,-0.0064141946,-0.040465176,-0.005626388,0.05133412,0.006753445,0.00042426027,-0.01422178,0.05940138,0.116743505,0.0011674578,-0.008659587,-0.04053525,-0.022214673,0.09895223,0.002719652,0.045001373,0.0008040994,0.019361302,0.062681645,0.08282797,0.09170734,0.015964976,0.0061003473,-0.008064309,-0.050786663,0.04034658,-0.06785674,0.046690237,-0.01608251,-0.02139474,-0.017698526,-0.12427137,-0.063697435,-0.041435402,0.059894145,0.037821535,0.031202836,-0.0368562,-0.009909677,0.015715342,0.04372128,0.011427944,-0.028688556,0.004889506,0.05489934,-0.018488688,-0.06512427,0.003697602,-0.11779431,0.024099747,-0.012698378,-0.083767995,0.00896139,0.0347107,-0.005833945,0.00977555,-0.017688036,0.0201122,0.0077704266,0.010662944,-0.03925409,0.0132224895,0.035226893,-0.016072752,0.0066985893,-0.038625628,0.045202196,0.022015031,-0.049517088,0.074939296,-0.032935277,0.017119886,-0.01855221,-0.08640024,0.078688115,0.042947732,0.031806406,0.11981495,0.077283874,0.015265355,-0.10528736,-0.08173607,0.061429318,0.011580919,0.0021366356,0.0016182783,-0.055341937,-0.019970192,-0.054518946,0.055475775,0.080809176,-0.12370892,-0.00018263733,-0.01750218,-0.050591014,-0.0072551696,0.06398248,0.024597887,0.025389653,0.015684184,-0.009363644,0.018653752,-0.091264665,5.341334e-33,-0.05113345,-0.05268398,0.0333511,0.07345077,-0.015279036,-0.013857048,-0.06695748,-0.009788194,0.05884732,0.059510626,-0.006685446,-0.18043174,0.021678163,0.07681608,0.08247314,0.04243236,-0.034204334,0.11003537,-0.04957873,0.096982345,-0.009486884,-0.033813957,0.045757346,-0.061337903,-0.0020040895,0.07650666,0.047693245,0.07603853,-0.029285721,-0.023823308,0.04972076,-0.05449579,-0.020476991,-0.081818245,0.0010089116,-0.0044222428,0.03435261,-0.010249684,0.011940609,0.019703168,0.006691812,0.052345917,0.086013906,0.048112947,0.05622996,0.013150958,-0.008556434,0.01032034,-0.013709926,0.06564768,-0.154393,0.012385668,-0.017988281,-0.04702939,0.021644926,0.112958066,-0.07095171,-0.0060108537,-0.1105795,0.032784622,-0.030630313,0.011715122,-0.02515241,-0.027158283,0.06827149,0.0510747,-0.032689333,-0.02494064,0.05882317,0.05537022,0.0050768065,-0.046489187,-0.018196221,0.015357404,-0.008885675,-0.050699245,-0.0057128756,0.055169124,0.042091884,-0.04845414,-0.02902063,-0.0047548255,-0.10822594,-0.09693646,-0.04664158,-0.04203777,0.04061572,-0.03392371,0.039154027,-0.02653025,-0.05571148,0.03256707,-0.09919531,0.056783054,-0.037664175,-6.4221444e-33,-0.033576984,0.039587528,0.0144360205,0.018809125,-0.07530379,0.021643393,0.030425275,-0.018595425,0.063068695,-0.003930882,-0.08156182,0.00010613702,0.05956377,0.05103013,-3.0130477e-05,0.03490662,0.072943315,-0.08272959,-0.008757717,-0.03543256,0.006115922,-0.0010217912,0.025023066,-0.07429481,-0.0778427,0.01664677,-0.09727262,0.06484606,-0.05790658,-0.09976745,-0.035275742,-0.057958297,-0.078329995,-0.042586394,-0.07957845,0.042864535,-0.031299103,0.055820197,-0.035949443,0.0044988855,-0.0013234649,0.03504516,-0.020908486,-0.14485957,0.016739003,0.033695426,0.04193586,-0.0074562263,0.005308688,-0.031401433,-0.052523598,0.04037801,-0.011455896,0.07492833,-0.0018832949,-0.052009743,-0.021709848,-0.022370733,-0.025711302,-0.0013013958,0.005564627,-0.061467376,-0.10446734,0.102683455,-0.03915866,0.028118186,0.0003843365,-0.0015800745,0.054562733,-0.00013121514,-0.014185387,-0.042645503,0.047772802,-0.007366538,-0.07147909,-0.061651696,-0.04157512,-0.013750867,0.014160523,0.0006023642,0.013669769,0.023831526,0.022920197,-0.017637184,-0.021481495,-0.0251641,0.022087427,0.053043697,-0.0057847886,0.0027825239,-0.080207765,0.02219479,-0.011576873,-0.035452027,-0.032537762,-5.8572063e-08,-0.098595224,0.027456367,0.09556231,0.012297263,-0.008334943,-0.011310503,-0.0058538993,0.00038720714,-0.019480249,0.0024531633,-0.036734074,0.02413119,-0.04006372,0.023550678,0.046090048,0.08967085,0.022495415,0.050229523,-0.009229862,-0.036300343,-0.014244502,-0.025231816,-0.04954492,-0.03225602,0.1366745,-0.01394981,0.0015357437,0.1569681,-0.041104086,0.047068294,-0.008588059,0.026153607,0.03005474,-0.0555643,0.14736092,-0.011762879,-0.02106289,0.0065236143,0.042829297,-0.030022439,-0.08122441,-0.019543571,-0.0129199205,0.034331124,0.14033382,-0.015961569,-0.0028301673,0.012448951,-0.018564574,-0.044466358,0.034973357,-0.011160856,-0.01487549,0.028318075,-0.049387284,0.06661709,-0.0035003317,-0.020373724,-0.04695607,0.013805385,0.021962898,0.10465381,-0.04235833,-0.049253397,0,-24.882582,-7.889535,12
114,"today's class start with discussion of population and sample. we want sample to estimate/predict population. for better results sample should be good and representative.
we can calculate count (frequency), mode, mean, median, standard deviation, variance.
we can also do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. if we calculate attributes from sample then it is known as statistics and when we calculate attributes from population then it is known as parameters. the second important thing what we have learnt today is simple linear regression. we took a example of sales v/s advertisements data and created a scatter plot and draws the best fit line having equation y=b0 + b1x.  here y represents dependent variable/response variable/label and x represents independent variable/feature and the b0 represents the bias which arises due to unknown variables which influencing the model. it has only one predictor. one amazing information is that we can also represents this line as a point but it is not correct model to represent the whole data. even a point can be considered as a model although a very naive model. we do not know all variables. in the equation y=b0 + b1x, b0 and b1 are the estimates of the population parameter. also, we have different model based on different sample. the difference between predicated y^ and y is error and we take sum of all squared error to minimize the error. we can't take only sum of errors as it nullify each other and there is of no use. a confidence interval (ci) is an interval which is expected to typically contain the parameter being estimated. important reasons behind taking sum of squared error is that it doesn't magnify the error and also doesn't differentiate between directions. we have 'closed form' solution to calculate the value of a, b and b0 and b1 are known as point estimates. one last thing is that we need to arrive at the possible interval with which these values lies such that there is a very high chances that b0p and b1p will lies within those intervals

157,"attributes are count, mean, median, mode while operations are sum, product etc. attributes for population these are called parameters. attributes for samples are called statistics. 

in supervised learning, simple regression model is regression model where y (dependent variable) is modelled c+mx where x is independent variable. here c represents bias term which represents all unaccounted factors(variables). c and m are called estimates of population parameters.
model is made from seen data to predict unseen situations.as the sample size increases, prediction error decreases and statistics get better.

when we find closed form estimated parameters, we have zero confidence in them because they are just points. confidence increases when we find intervals for estimated parameters.

to find the estimates, we try to find parameters which minimises some defined function of ei= yi-yi^{hat} which is called loss functions.

some famous loss functions are:

161,"today's lecture covered population parameters, sample statistics, and simple linear regression with the equation y = bâ‚€ + bâ‚x, where bâ‚€ (intercept) and bâ‚ (slope) estimate population parameters. bias was defined as the effect of unaccounted variables.

we compared error methods like sum of absolute errors and sum of squared errors (sse), favoring sse for its sensitivity to outliers. formulas for bâ‚€ and bâ‚ were derived, and confidence intervals were introduced for more reliable parameter estimation. this formed the basis of regression modeling and error analysis.",-0.023170305,-0.022346912,-0.0045620594,0.18997513,-0.017928842,0.060033444,0.011941292,0.055495605,-0.007764509,0.00086739316,0.11017837,-0.039525237,0.10242099,-0.059911687,-0.034989495,-0.06637125,0.034745175,0.0032652367,-0.012960984,-0.051794026,-0.046797376,0.054219402,-0.031368386,0.036114536,0.015291932,-0.06507896,-0.03900608,-0.029068084,-0.04947916,0.032438,-0.011616988,0.073584564,0.027673084,-0.04258215,0.010183168,-0.10100615,0.026580568,0.06687802,-0.02945753,0.01956192,0.0046009547,0.0078613,0.064836904,0.031468026,0.022760734,-0.017363248,0.01976686,-0.0329372,-0.07574982,0.08264193,0.016434599,-0.011977159,-0.0027121329,0.0132057415,-0.008191294,-0.10529569,-0.07614049,-0.00026472347,0.06514849,0.08453483,0.0002647781,0.025586091,-0.0015412552,0.02289082,0.045585077,0.059626024,-0.022828288,0.004166306,-0.008147508,0.029862955,-0.03300455,-0.008875256,-0.12936047,0.041413892,0.014698028,-0.10163083,0.06531185,0.013456676,0.038253523,0.005257449,-0.0057056425,-0.038979743,-0.038449686,-0.022065261,0.027110104,-0.028699245,0.0252589,0.021448873,-0.0102430815,-0.00075002236,0.06394527,0.077919744,-0.023832155,0.07881114,-0.0049511543,-0.00055284426,-0.035291262,0.0146871675,0.050547663,0.02606576,-0.008359182,0.063397616,0.011296678,0.081604,-0.028121743,-0.015887616,0.090631135,-0.04127251,0.0049567767,0.037349664,-0.06138617,-0.013847467,0.016901052,0.043291904,0.030026106,-0.15508057,0.06359492,0.015806518,-0.0044049313,-0.07058689,0.04410146,0.033107772,0.046110798,0.026513837,-0.043684475,0.020898819,-0.10019767,7.068419e-33,-0.039502762,0.007977941,-0.013365799,0.014394347,-0.012869321,-0.061313752,-0.03224037,-0.009122987,0.06745463,0.06883642,-0.034778204,-0.10738966,-0.04674372,0.004873444,0.07210908,0.1001295,0.035795115,0.06735963,-0.018226836,0.07763047,-0.024962353,-0.06297993,0.035687827,0.005006561,-0.02200796,0.087958366,0.06442172,0.051824905,-0.039224036,-0.013804062,0.11828929,-0.057789993,-0.013548524,-0.10739944,-0.03815292,-0.028859345,0.00645654,0.04757667,0.006441665,0.065336294,-0.013866896,0.062661625,0.10036135,-0.014481781,0.066896416,0.003108269,0.04847666,-0.050623994,0.06657357,0.058784764,-0.12619394,-0.0033930878,-0.0035520254,0.048592176,-0.004197926,0.06394395,-0.07125844,0.040208958,-0.04737159,0.019252932,-0.06574137,-0.008764369,0.010352762,-0.105139,0.10454162,0.034042995,0.033009883,0.05428895,-0.048078332,0.0041842246,0.015968062,-0.046168018,-0.08324484,0.014939069,-0.08249954,-0.022612091,0.026643949,-0.033441972,0.041774582,-0.08195934,0.0032237405,0.0023475909,-0.053221814,-0.031052208,0.0033783207,0.010663549,0.02744793,-0.01866745,0.04215978,0.0076217297,0.017352236,-0.028228167,-0.114192694,0.013003089,-0.035859548,-6.7972704e-33,-0.046439912,0.07749104,-0.012259369,-0.017313913,-0.059048224,-0.022235945,0.08134573,-0.0066296114,0.059244197,-0.04790589,-0.14132454,-0.019397551,-0.003588821,0.06281127,0.073364004,0.019103216,-0.017362738,-0.046633836,-0.047198314,-0.021916108,-0.04748295,-0.022804722,0.09575295,0.00213648,-0.07913791,0.03654993,-0.06898413,0.10092248,-0.07716079,-0.071791194,0.035072364,-0.018744789,-0.048942506,-0.03312431,-0.03376005,0.009054737,0.0008195594,0.05816957,-0.022810128,-0.01674847,-0.03456658,0.10399271,-0.030026251,-0.09423094,0.0025390224,0.11376016,0.07013545,-0.029916056,0.008052316,0.00024348503,-0.011990814,0.036936387,-0.005582758,0.07890294,-0.059186466,-0.046778798,-0.0019949498,-0.008273505,0.046101406,0.013862309,-0.011440604,-0.0002511287,-0.03543308,-0.008465383,-0.07511442,0.052354835,-0.0067121005,-0.017287936,-0.020625385,0.0044701993,-0.023255428,-0.07634781,-0.0070604174,-0.03193331,-0.0660463,0.0015717504,-0.059193403,0.011032305,0.023961693,-0.0017110583,0.029128421,-0.015789509,0.06857374,-0.0819309,-0.078708135,-0.04099272,0.030703172,0.010141516,-0.01607199,-0.0065462505,-0.09918,-0.020325206,0.009432819,-0.07560927,0.012828711,-5.2337395e-08,-0.078424506,0.07718359,0.010347366,0.016084265,0.0043680924,-0.029835936,-0.060311276,0.013798803,-0.025427464,-0.009667412,-0.022109732,-0.016179971,0.004605345,0.02717109,-0.024891896,0.0758598,0.013665439,0.10769537,0.011118728,0.012868659,0.019120548,0.05173442,-0.07049861,-0.067062415,0.08517553,-0.012901365,-0.023624541,0.17348939,0.027371177,0.07308047,0.036669087,-0.03164796,0.042534582,-0.029888889,0.09678918,0.011701013,-0.04259224,-0.057321046,0.0005250274,-0.035727594,-0.029659113,0.025905108,-0.008142279,0.05616305,0.03224848,-0.016318362,0.03398608,0.026591457,-0.009951554,-0.1086003,0.03965256,-0.13409969,-0.017185932,0.034946237,-0.014450937,-0.010154185,0.008861299,0.00060096243,-0.00055236096,0.026413333,0.02312582,-0.011673301,-0.019393083,-0.09940072,0,-26.742584,-5.1557403,12
162,"we started by looking into what statistics is in simple terms. it is using sample to predict and understand the overall population. then the estimate that we make for a sample is a statistic and it is the best estimate that we obtain of the actual population value called the parameter(population parameter). then we started looking into linear regression. we started with the example of sales vs advertisement data that of a company. there was like an upward pattern, where the sales was increasing with the increase in advertisement. the objective was to find a curve that could give a function 'f' in y=f(x) for this problem. we tried a linear function, y = b0+b1x. we saw that the term b0 is called bias because, it is telling that there is a bias in the output variable that even

175,"predicting population from samples
our objective is to accurately predict population characteristics based on a representative sample. for instance, measuring the heights of all indian citizens by solely sampling primary school students would be an inadequate approach.
key concepts
â€¢	attributes: count, mode, mean, median, standard deviation, variance.
â€¢	operators: count, add, subtract, multiply, divide.
â€¢	levels of measurement: 
o	nominal level:
ï‚§	attributes: count, mode 
ï‚§	operators: count
o	ordinal level:
ï‚§	attributes: count, mode, median 
ï‚§	operators: count
o	interval level:
ï‚§	attributes: count, mode, mean, median, standard deviation, variance 
ï‚§	operators: count, add, subtract
o	ratio level:
ï‚§	attributes: count, mode, mean, median, standard deviation, variance 
ï‚§	operators: count, add, subtract, multiply, divide
these attributes and operators provide estimates of population qualities. however, we must also account for the inherent error in these estimates.
â€¢	population: provides parameters.
â€¢	sample: provides statistics.
linear regression
suppose we collect a substantial dataset and model it using the equation:
â€¢	y = b0 + b1x
â€¢	y: dependent variable, response variable, or label.
â€¢	x: independent variable, feature, or predictor.
this linear model, while simplistic, provides a foundational understanding.
when performing linear regression on multiple samples (s1, s2) from the same population, we obtain different models. consequently, the calculated values for b0 and b1 are estimates or statistics of the true population parameters (b0p and b1p).
confidence intervals
the true population parameters (b0p and b1p) are typically unknown. therefore, we estimate their range using confidence intervals.
â€¢	b0p lies within the interval: b0 - d to b0 + d
â€¢	a point interval has 0% confidence, while an infinite interval has 100% confidence.
model fit and error minimization
to determine the best-fit line, we compare actual y values (yi) with the model's predicted values (yi-hat). the difference (error, ei) is calculated.
â€¢	error minimization: 
o	manhattan error: summation of |ei|
o	euclidean error: summation of ei^2
minimizing euclidean error often leads to a closed-form solution for b0 and b1, as in linear regression. however, this is not always the case.
point estimates and confidence intervals
ultimately, b0 and b1 are point estimates. to enhance our understanding, we construct confidence intervals (e.g., 95%, 90%, 99%) within which the true population parameters (b0p and b1p) are likely to reside.

177,"in today's session, we discussed attributes like count, mean, mode, median, standard deviation, variance, etc which serve as a parameter for population and statistics for sample data. based on the sample, we can only estimate the attributes of the population. depending on the observations (or features) we decide which machine learning technique will produce the best predictions with minimal error. linear regression equation ( y=ax+b) where b is the bias which represents the effect of the sum of all unknown features that we have not accounted for. here, in this case, 'a' and 'b' variables are the population parameter estimates. as we increase the sample size we get better estimates. the interval range of these statistic parameters ( a and b) is called the confidence interval. the higher the confidence, the higher the interval size, and the lower the confidence, the lower the interval size. the exact value of 'a' and 'b' are point estimates and their confidence is zero percent. the mean of observations lies on the line of linear regression. we minimize the sum of the square of error of each observation to get the best line equation for linear regression.",-0.051383894,0.04842595,0.02244404,0.08988841,0.047115486,0.059239015,-0.040947642,0.045243144,0.009546919,0.0048532286,-0.002476982,0.029702974,0.04989705,-0.055211127,0.05300763,0.056782126,0.030757787,-0.019575583,-0.025357097,-0.015861973,0.04766728,-0.005614173,-0.016247451,0.040344518,0.039201647,-0.029933088,-0.027836923,-0.02938599,-0.006028808,0.023764687,-0.0040373183,0.028581476,0.034458715,-0.06300565,-0.06007986,-0.052608382,0.025803154,0.08587571,0.01824233,-0.022211181,-0.017645154,-0.019467968,0.047813322,0.09236698,0.111253895,0.10891547,0.045381516,-0.030742642,-0.052864645,0.027874185,-0.071085244,-0.0072742277,-0.053428702,-0.0057059536,-0.037755113,-0.09048954,-0.08344553,0.034421414,0.082753316,0.093913674,-0.056426693,-0.04800328,0.028415743,0.025104174,0.024977297,-0.0009529214,-0.031949982,0.021386802,-0.06924934,0.029089473,-0.006476567,0.060687095,-0.090264626,0.03433438,0.027648153,-0.062424406,0.0030770288,0.025602646,-0.00896243,0.08479054,-0.002453999,0.06818932,-0.045425717,0.035593852,0.0329215,-0.022266382,-0.025146808,-0.03436361,-0.11175058,-0.014634609,0.028157147,-0.04497173,-0.08926504,0.03765687,-0.01016591,0.030082548,-0.033362485,-0.08888816,0.022428432,0.042466886,-0.04590417,0.063649446,0.03985233,0.018978013,0.025623465,-0.009783108,0.012347165,-0.055768788,0.07098586,0.006646361,-0.0041748695,-0.007455885,-0.100948006,-0.002800269,0.08913414,-0.04014875,-0.00065137964,-0.014176902,-0.0110692,0.007760247,0.026990294,0.025306609,0.065317154,0.03923917,-0.0013550156,0.068324216,-0.10986282,2.0696193e-33,0.0001678119,-0.03336879,-0.010334411,0.015015334,0.0036867184,-0.037743464,0.0064065345,-0.028420627,0.11548917,0.05728231,-0.04864988,-0.10914922,0.03213895,0.067070134,0.10468493,0.07486371,0.0332881,0.07472375,-0.053592253,-0.034442186,0.011611012,-0.07032017,0.03685493,0.020168085,-0.043149427,-0.025653392,0.07607457,0.08692126,-0.05938018,-0.018344026,0.0061379117,0.013286004,0.016125029,-0.016153542,-0.014026006,-0.046431895,-0.032823946,-0.020187087,0.036416113,0.08483528,0.008308259,0.03482969,0.042651292,-0.010150981,0.06852328,-0.0020263453,-0.04154235,-0.0070826374,-0.05134504,0.034421846,-0.053848438,-0.013872495,-0.0050361985,0.0052713347,-0.004165462,0.116580985,-0.07520993,-0.038970172,-0.11954564,-0.0057144053,-0.01108258,-0.052069776,0.015922416,-0.03571533,0.006993021,0.09672939,0.10351984,0.026299415,0.052504774,-0.011711945,0.047273416,-0.056122486,-0.044196926,-0.0025154436,0.059475087,-0.032334726,0.0371002,-0.0011684243,0.036372818,-0.016526587,0.018642966,0.012700665,-0.045913007,-0.06863598,-0.008806839,0.004311405,0.022191249,-0.035938982,0.021054823,-0.07181759,-0.108868554,0.03654065,-0.08310892,0.049966,-0.03876521,-2.5539126e-33,0.0072243186,-0.04204716,-0.00904615,0.03065623,-0.0567651,-0.010054503,0.05089709,-0.0834695,0.009964824,-0.051312193,-0.080387846,-0.022927959,0.057931468,0.0345821,0.028364647,0.07366999,-0.052697465,-0.07645005,0.0144371865,0.010143978,-0.028903883,0.0045973123,0.033630904,0.0022833652,-0.03833905,-0.035476208,-0.09551231,0.08763076,-0.00924469,-0.09268728,-0.040888358,-0.06424694,-0.07153009,-0.09477722,-0.016799528,0.049530167,-0.008556421,-0.018088028,-0.01959374,0.08432485,0.03609313,0.015640019,0.016451338,-0.113084026,-0.037956618,0.01195025,-0.00027882092,-0.041404787,0.056199968,-0.052730735,0.018392347,0.057144392,-0.037734848,0.046015892,-0.052448113,-0.050162386,-0.076035276,0.026220703,0.045108374,0.03564745,-0.028729813,-0.036530215,-0.08011835,0.09202794,-0.061175786,0.05737702,0.012101359,0.012451993,-0.02952987,-0.004359787,-0.030834652,-0.017556908,0.047910355,0.016030654,-0.1240909,-0.04243199,-0.021853784,-0.08943793,-0.0576,-0.012176264,0.02398344,-0.025998306,0.002404293,-0.009785614,-0.019363549,-8.191311e-06,0.035159916,0.036229555,-0.0011860568,-0.028264536,-0.090241395,0.05118707,-0.10949201,-0.009747645,-0.03402061,-6.820857e-08,-0.06884226,0.1030459,0.04940526,-0.011300903,0.07827775,0.049660765,-0.02096165,0.042904023,-0.037088115,0.0155078,0.033447605,0.039153893,-0.013396841,0.024357868,0.0020266408,0.08926485,-0.01973259,-0.003849645,0.024737842,-0.009891218,0.0064135576,-0.038721744,-0.0010378336,-0.109308526,0.14248413,-0.107715204,-0.003398647,0.10054404,0.026655404,0.07325739,-0.05215889,0.0029783142,0.072632566,-0.042811412,0.13924696,0.073327735,0.031119727,-0.07004458,-0.0035408596,-0.03415492,0.00094336557,0.049069516,0.017560339,0.009427863,0.08001368,-0.055701144,0.08498223,0.0036805733,-0.0013993491,-0.055233978,0.14345834,-0.07043778,0.025971433,0.09367965,0.04179612,0.04393291,-0.020099653,0.0028213833,0.006373009,0.050451297,0.075682394,0.04169712,0.011212291,-0.0058608376,0,-25.633127,-8.642653,12

 key concepts:
1. population and sample:
   - population: the entire group of interest.
   - sample: a subset of the population used to infer properties of the population.

2. parameters and statistics:
   - parameters: characteristics of a population.
   - statistics: calculated measures from a sample that estimate population parameters.

3. measures of central tendency and dispersion:
   - mean, median, mode: describe the center of data.
   - standard deviation, variance: measure the spread of data.
   - basic operations (e.g., count, add, subtract, multiply, divide) were applied to both population and sample data.

4. dependent and independent variables:
   - dependent variable y: the outcome we are trying to predict or explain.
   - independent variable (x): the predictor or input variable influencing y.

5. simple linear regression (slr):
   - regression line equation:  y = beta_0 + beta_1 x .
   - estimation of coefficients beta_0 and beta_1:
     - calculated from sample data as 'point estimates' of population parameters.
     - recognized that point estimates may not exactly match population parameters but are close approximations.
     - interval estimates: used to state a confidence range (e.g., 95%) where population parameters likely lie.

6. goal of slr:
   - minimize sse (sum of squared errors):
     - sse measures the total deviation of observed values from the predicted line.
   - brief derivation: covered the mathematical basis for minimizing sse to find optimal coefficients.

212,"we started with an explanation of population and sample. a sample should be a good representative of the population. we train our model on the sample and predict or interpret for the whole population. we have to predict the parameters of the population using the sample's statistics. these statistics include count, mean, mode, standard error, median, standard deviation, and variance.

in y = f(x), y is the dependent variable, and x is the independent variable. for simple linear regression, the form of the equation is y = b0 + b1x, where our job is to predict b0 and b1 to best fit our data. for different samples, the values of b0 and b1 may vary, which is why we introduce confidence intervals.

point estimates give a single value for a population parameter but may not be accurate due to variation in samples. interval estimates provide a range where the true population value is likely to be, with a certain level of confidence. for example, we can say we are 95% confident that our b0 or b1 lies within this interval.

236,"we discussed population parameters and sample statistics such as mean, median, and variance. in simple linear regression, we introduced the equation y = bâ‚€ + bâ‚x, where bâ‚€(intercept) and bâ‚(slope) are sample estimates of population parameters. bias was defined as the influence of unaccounted variables in the model.  
we explored error calculation methods like sum of absolute errors and sum of squared errors (sse), with sse preferred for its sensitivity to large deviations. different samples yield different regression lines, so evaluating errors is crucial to determine accuracy.  
we derived formulas to compute bâ‚€ and bâ‚and discussed confidence intervals for estimating population parameters, which offer better reliability compared to point estimates. this established the basis of regression modeling and error analysis.",0.017235793,-0.013924416,0.013576125,0.14798874,-0.013486261,0.060008485,0.0036671106,0.07789418,0.013133393,-0.039322067,0.054605942,-0.06049542,0.090836,-0.03682863,-0.050231148,-0.042671878,0.016022488,-0.016010178,0.0146403415,-0.019978719,-0.0050545726,0.097232275,-0.03531067,0.079912014,0.037886832,-0.046540897,-0.079238065,0.023852102,-0.052433185,0.054426365,0.019622704,-0.006817029,0.04096155,-0.019832743,0.007773951,-0.064962536,0.0065141036,0.057572175,-0.035010204,0.009232198,-0.02872121,-0.024057511,0.084356785,0.039670445,0.019352172,-0.00456457,0.009798662,-0.024339499,-0.02433961,0.11483461,-0.0027020874,0.017554753,0.05481174,-0.0062295822,0.012944002,-0.05736746,-0.055205893,-7.985466e-05,0.056131013,0.08601723,-0.012315163,0.046815075,0.009619091,0.012014157,0.0443878,0.07028523,-0.004347249,-0.016923357,0.0037299744,0.029280864,-0.07681067,-0.02102206,-0.12806445,0.043090682,-0.0014633549,-0.06351636,0.05479061,-0.001304867,0.0055217305,0.0024543288,-0.028435394,-0.014071504,-0.00085906335,0.024842983,0.06263921,0.010228413,0.09308361,0.037581928,-0.07320955,-0.03212006,0.029410057,0.088963754,-0.05102751,0.057142098,0.0067197667,0.058889374,-0.0800421,-0.07499934,0.030365178,-0.009705733,-0.016194249,0.065579444,0.02728005,5.7768368e-05,-0.028471157,-0.027485076,0.040886022,-0.028384369,-0.022542339,0.05783967,-0.087556876,-0.013715586,-0.07143757,0.07606865,0.06725195,-0.14016987,-0.030942047,0.006573117,0.072822355,0.013141771,0.04327659,0.017167054,0.07789644,-0.0032773314,-0.013077411,0.031101953,-0.03732527,6.201497e-33,-0.04019279,-0.00060042756,-0.0015358992,0.06438088,-0.04622953,-0.064111,-0.063639715,-0.005070288,0.06416559,0.046439443,-0.02058567,-0.11710088,-0.009928166,-0.04000971,0.093379356,0.103915736,0.008656725,0.03557762,-0.09621924,0.10107808,-0.022372289,-0.054006077,0.066150874,0.002638906,-0.010036438,0.04632926,0.044551607,0.11275876,-0.07905805,-0.02157818,0.022848926,-0.058506913,-0.030855063,-0.13369946,-0.09121568,-0.019477382,0.023554465,0.023916952,0.011927906,0.052763555,-0.0038985168,0.07526882,0.09187608,0.017638424,0.046801027,0.02397096,0.008063074,-0.05097453,0.03548376,0.042156134,-0.12584628,-0.006262763,0.0212352,0.022228012,-0.010680279,0.10068055,-0.051205993,0.026068626,-0.04710893,-0.01741618,-0.0834577,-0.0049384907,0.014458208,-0.11151658,0.09964186,0.039616805,0.0045873416,0.06509536,0.012186692,0.004481137,0.010172356,-0.0646322,-0.04963788,0.013626621,-0.06824558,-0.054214846,-0.0030483657,-0.018599011,0.03407178,-0.019276975,0.038904186,0.018531445,-0.07602282,-0.039004866,0.06676253,-0.01670584,0.030172242,-0.018089574,-0.045063924,0.010349566,-0.00065238186,-0.0054573347,-0.054540638,-0.0072117774,-0.098006606,-6.988951e-33,-0.10709166,0.0601021,0.018592618,0.054689802,-0.07050349,-0.033018008,0.03796259,-0.017835518,0.044648364,-0.054267354,-0.15154326,-0.05691305,0.022279268,0.061530814,0.054294143,0.049094226,-0.02350268,-0.08453884,-0.030795269,-0.008171631,0.01491664,0.010079249,0.068085484,0.012849101,-0.10285629,0.0044399793,-0.082227536,0.047168408,-0.040897347,-0.11720635,0.055105895,-0.044552434,-0.011469514,-0.0120537635,-0.0028684274,-0.014288801,-0.021215767,0.0498939,-0.010568315,-0.00025243466,0.03642265,0.063865036,-0.04351917,-0.102292836,0.0139436815,0.09432288,0.07975914,-0.039022088,-0.037951145,0.03615549,-0.023750875,0.02002807,-0.08896414,0.045843095,-0.019253425,-0.06508863,-0.026421444,-0.012174352,0.0020099308,-0.022876645,-0.035879176,-0.0070291017,-0.056010723,0.05725869,-0.041921157,0.0592315,-0.00576179,-0.049592383,-0.018783988,0.04907267,-0.03822958,-0.044582337,0.040287744,-0.012734463,-0.04146597,-0.014419497,-0.016416723,0.02497609,-0.0052647414,-0.023514906,0.017379673,-0.024131833,0.02055586,-0.046893205,-0.046420135,-0.035386592,0.058198698,-0.020987308,0.020995189,-0.025054645,-0.0724499,0.039616846,-0.062992245,-0.10442929,0.006054289,-5.260777e-08,-0.031088196,0.10810288,0.031484384,0.046788573,-0.018499684,-0.011517744,-0.024493014,-0.028580898,-0.042172622,-0.022038389,-0.005004664,-0.0016075557,-0.013215765,-0.0039401692,-0.033675984,0.083701015,0.07078157,0.1761831,0.008198694,0.0427142,-0.004937483,0.021216402,-0.05473713,-0.038716085,0.049411815,-0.007402584,-0.0018993665,0.14872833,-0.008949614,0.03450206,0.04302368,-0.043761928,0.022158423,-0.01778022,0.05819259,-0.019542692,-0.018514324,-0.018913468,0.04654955,-0.02937758,-0.0044703116,0.049733922,-0.03454725,0.052747868,0.056468815,0.015741961,0.04623503,0.010577683,0.011603115,-0.09119913,0.04410404,-0.1214712,-0.062571324,0.05829372,-0.02333937,0.03008654,0.0137141105,-0.0016376739,0.03918598,-0.017085107,0.023290576,0.0030165408,-0.026857598,-0.062196348,0,-26.753883,-5.09003,12
251,"in todays lecture, we started with the continuation of the previous lectures discussion on population and sample. population has its parameters and sample has statistics. we want to estimate the parameters based on the statistics. we then moved our discussion towards coming up with a model from a dataset. depending upon the type of scatter plot of the data, we might want to fit a different model. suppose there is a dataset where all points seem to be more or less unaffected by the parameters and more like scattered in a particular circular region, we might want to find its point estimate. if the 2 parameters seem to be linearly varying with each other, as in the example of marketing expense vs revenue, we might want to fit a line to it. now the question arises - how do we fit the best line? for that, we use simple linear regression. suppose our lines predicts a y hat for a given x and the real value corresponding to that x is y, we define error e = y hat - y. we want our line to be such that this error is minimum. we do so by minimising the sum of square of this errors. we finally arrived at direct formulas for the slope and intercept of the equation.",-0.061518777,0.009665778,0.0026035865,0.06268019,0.056455966,0.052510966,0.0021186066,0.06264021,0.036867324,0.028107869,0.027866967,0.01991385,0.067611836,-0.0043281103,0.006659095,-0.057830315,0.011289432,-0.010969938,0.00548413,0.019283423,0.047691327,-0.051539008,-0.076052345,0.046462808,-0.035386227,0.008288452,0.06009058,0.009986643,-0.07032627,-0.04712207,0.027994428,0.010124877,0.020191964,0.013586602,0.005205333,-0.041696224,0.0079040695,0.09746596,0.01838849,0.026873354,-0.00957347,0.017676862,0.021529883,0.038924716,0.09439127,-0.0829978,0.04193124,0.022674756,-0.020204626,0.05055296,-0.027830763,0.019880077,-0.00045902844,0.02586532,0.047184594,-0.036498874,-0.0046558315,-0.010289591,0.08665758,0.028072648,0.013960483,-0.051366314,0.021567902,0.026335556,0.045751717,-0.02695437,0.020592721,0.030665042,-0.044318303,0.066457056,-0.099309415,0.04146066,-0.08586519,-0.0029559506,0.003853333,-0.04231679,0.015589603,-0.0039695483,-0.036439005,0.018211687,0.021047879,0.042961378,0.020436516,0.019328438,0.0016060878,0.037068762,-0.021879923,-0.051836308,0.07488357,-0.06989403,-0.0031826014,0.068041325,-0.11918013,0.07957567,-0.00033456064,0.04670799,-0.0029261366,-0.056316294,0.0635924,0.061338875,0.030103061,0.05323241,0.067581736,-0.002838059,-0.0041681416,-0.086165376,-0.022240115,-0.013044749,-0.010760786,0.009782227,-0.03794445,-0.056750808,-0.06096615,0.073852345,0.07595833,-0.12826338,0.024831798,-0.009236081,-0.0707482,0.00842008,-0.05289936,0.030230673,0.008033331,0.061374832,0.023793567,0.065547496,-0.036918372,8.497294e-34,-0.09122875,0.0014339864,0.004947915,0.03592873,-0.051076036,-0.064197674,-0.047852542,0.026008755,0.08567285,0.09916968,-0.029007852,-0.11625544,0.017883804,0.047257233,0.11706861,0.035393607,-0.054605216,0.051688075,-0.08067303,0.05262471,-0.10507968,-0.06886225,0.026229449,-0.067525655,-0.011310416,-0.016701264,-0.002149566,0.0775525,-0.0003566923,-0.021175014,0.045337547,0.016166361,0.023451978,-0.018155187,-0.024330728,-0.069590054,-0.034436073,-0.017103666,-0.01757728,0.04964185,0.04476459,0.121962234,0.086512685,0.042448018,0.06448297,0.07885936,0.02391343,0.023699095,-0.011707307,0.008518487,-0.09482354,-0.032172054,-0.012468427,-0.01349698,0.024807883,0.06142631,-0.12856555,-0.09898615,-0.024989385,-0.0019584415,-0.021994896,-0.06803503,-0.0063679945,-0.046821192,0.07505418,0.03601079,0.0117420945,-0.037186675,0.02791875,-0.024036406,0.017153228,-0.023254966,-0.06658958,0.050390426,0.05070967,-0.081865385,-0.004416035,0.058764316,0.0032813733,-0.061813504,-0.00010780534,0.026976125,-0.09314754,-0.06767338,-0.0112377275,-0.056143455,0.038922124,-0.07411112,0.01592802,-0.046490155,-0.007569787,0.03687745,-0.10251541,0.044961236,0.00033998318,-2.6352816e-33,0.009814143,0.06887663,0.03934487,0.040600535,-0.010259745,0.024271185,-0.047966503,-0.047097433,0.07585613,0.005416289,-0.12277533,0.0012820647,0.014200882,0.057965923,0.02422236,0.060423344,0.059409596,-0.083238594,-0.003877222,-0.08218,-0.012009972,-0.07205963,-0.005634527,-0.057841863,-0.035700697,0.02423095,-0.07909265,0.05911055,-0.06718683,-0.06438263,-0.05483144,-0.025439091,-0.04123837,-0.0815365,-0.08290631,0.10897583,-0.06399252,0.0878469,0.0093132425,0.029553527,-0.012949994,0.02634228,-0.018255949,-0.11857227,-0.013804913,0.018650956,0.062747985,-0.035282977,-0.031792182,-0.02197824,-0.02708408,0.061204124,-0.0022348308,0.01748893,-0.06104228,-0.006460614,-0.059915844,0.027075106,-0.013185346,-0.0521114,-0.0026994057,-0.03522793,-0.13586806,0.110159695,-0.07153613,0.019377925,0.030542837,-0.07088789,0.008750853,0.009241612,-0.07608743,-0.08898932,0.03997572,0.05248199,-0.03619339,-0.06321303,0.0022792115,-0.07412272,-0.015983703,0.007248918,0.027563905,-0.0067020818,0.036663055,-0.03125005,-0.026687736,0.0012824704,-0.002259498,-0.014594812,-0.011764667,-0.008172155,-0.008845036,0.0017074927,-0.035168953,-0.028996686,0.020131093,-7.114041e-08,-0.11151511,0.004312063,0.062827595,0.011148591,0.022288563,0.009374687,0.05688055,0.017867189,0.02616289,0.0019086553,-0.014359004,0.10132894,0.0013438634,0.06834129,-0.02120466,0.057169605,-0.0068747103,0.025886735,-0.017808601,0.065543704,-0.020522427,-0.018836176,-0.102388695,-0.010297996,0.16669682,-0.05554276,0.07226919,0.13155122,-0.048142105,0.08878428,-0.015840076,0.0019170542,0.0070636924,0.022961196,0.034667287,-0.047409326,-0.03996068,-0.008543636,-0.00236983,-0.011739126,0.014599609,0.08004179,0.002766719,-0.038290147,0.15153047,0.029519344,0.05723724,-0.024174761,-0.042638894,-0.047653966,0.014577333,-0.04786241,0.024810692,-0.00932982,-0.019443559,-0.07222216,-0.054072525,0.052513245,-0.032580223,0.0077840695,-0.030354086,0.073207036,-0.012384609,-0.06723901,0,-24.06971,-9.764887,12
261,"today we discussed about simple linear regression mainly but we also covered population and sample. usually to predict something about the population we use sample data but how close is this prediction to the actual value depends upon how good the method used for collecting data was. and discussing upon this we shifted towards the visualization of the data and then deciding which model is better to predict the unseen data. for a linearly distributed points we can use point model, or some circular model and it will give some results but they will not be close to the actual value therefore it is necessary that we visualize and then decide which model. as sir mentioned math is blind it will throw out numbers for the data points when applied but it's us who are responsible to choose the right model. we plotted a example graph which was linearly distributed and thus thought to use simple linear regression. from here we saw math behind linear regression and what mean ,median, mode and frequency actually mean for the data and how important it is

280,"today's lecture started off with a discussion about the difference between population and sample. sample is a small subset representing the entire population because gathering data for the entire population can be very difficult. so the sample should be a good representative of the population, and we should be able to predict the population's behaviour from the sample. there are various statistical attributes of data which can be calculated. some of them are frequency, mean, median, mode, std. deviation, variance, etc. if these attributes are calculated for the sample, they are called as statistics, whereas if they are estimated for the population, they are called the parameters. so our main focus with data science and ml is to estimate the parameters from the statistics. 
then we moved on to simple linear regression, where we have only one influencing or independent variable steering our predictions. our model is basically of the form y = ax + b, where x is the independent variable (predictor, feature), y is the dependent variable (response variable, label) and b is the bias term. the bias term accounts for all the unknown variables influencing our predictions. so as and when we bring more and more influencing variables into our model, the bias term keeps on reducing. 
one special thing that sir mentioned today was that a model can be as simple as a point. even a point predictor can be a model, however it may not be relevant for any practical usage and may not represent our data well. 
so a and b are the statistics of the population parameters. we also defined a confidence interval, which is the interval of values within which the parameters lie. the larger the confidence interval, the more confident we can be of the parameter value lying in that interval. then we also talked about minimising the error between our predictions and the actual data value at a given point. we said that the error can be formulated in various ways, but the most optimum way is to consider the sum of the squared errors, as that is something which is least influenced by the sign and the direction of fluctuation, and hence should be the best choice for minimisation. upon doing minimisation, we calculated the values of the statistics a and b. however these were closed form solution which were basically point estimates of the parameters. these estimates might not give us any confidence about the actual parameter values, hence we also need to find a possible interval within which the value of the parameters can exist with a very high

289,"we learnt:
-samples should be representative
-a narrow definition of the population may allow us to sample the whole population
-for every sample we can find the following three for the data:
   1. level of measurement- nominal/ordinal/interval/ratio
   2. attributes- count(frequency), mean, median, mode...
   3. operations- count, add, subtract, multiply...
-""we estimate a parameter for a population and we calculate a statistic for a sample.""
-finally, ""we wish to estimate the parameters from the calculated statistics.""
-from the scatter plot of a given data we decide if linear model is a good fit
-for the same data we might even use a single point as the model, but that is a naive model
-slr terms- dependent/independent variables; bias
-bias occurs due to the other variables' effect on the dependent variable
-the model that we create is particular to the specific sample that was used to create it, and so each sample of a population yields a different model
-the credibilty of a model then depends on the sample-taker's job
-we calculate b0 and b1 using the sample and based on that we find an interval where we are confident that the population parameter lies
-point estimate- zero confidence

291,"simple linear regression is a statistical method used to predict the value of a dependent variable based on one independent variable by fitting a straight line. if there are more than one variable it is called multiple linear regression. sample data represents a subset of the population used for analysis, while population data includes the entire dataset of interest. we use our sample to estimates the parameters of the population by beta 0 and beta 1. different sample can result in different model with different accuracy .the best-fit line minimizes the sum of squared differences between observed and predicted values. it provides insights into the relationship between variables, helping in prediction and trend analysis.

308,"in today's lecture, we built on our previous discussion about the distinction between a population and a sample. additionally, we delved deeper into simple linear regression (slr), exploring its concepts and applications. below is a detailed summary of the topics covered.

1. sample vs population
    1. sample is a part of the population which we use to predict the parameters of population.
    2. it should be a good representation of the population otherwise parameter estimates would be way off the mark.
    
    then we defined some formal terms for population and sample.
    
    properties of samples are called â€œstatisticsâ€
    
    properties of samples are called â€œparametersâ€
    
    we use statistics to estimate parameters.
    
2. then we delved into what operations can be applied on data captured via different scales of measurement
    1. nominal / ordinal: you can perform operations like counting, addition, subtraction
    2. interval / ratio: you can perform operations like counting, addition, subtraction, mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance etc.
3. simple linear regression (slr)
    1. when we have one independent variable(x) and one dependent variable(y)
    2. independent variable(x): feature, predictor
    3. dependent variable(y): response variable, label
    4. we had a dataset of 100 points, plotted a scatter plot and observed that y is linearly dependent on x and decided to use slr (a line of form: a + bx) to solve the problem.
    5. reason for this offset â€˜aâ€™ is the unaccounted features which affects the target variable. we can also say that magnitude of bias = sum of all unaccounted feature in the system
    6. we discussed how parameter estimates vary depending on sample variability. to address this, we need to use a sample set that accurately represents the population, or our parameter estimates will be inaccurate.
    7. the parameter estimates (a, b) for sure will not be same as true population parameter. thus we use the concept of confidence interval where we find the probability of true population parameter in some range around the parameter estimates.
    8. finally, we explored how to find the best-fit straight line by examining various loss functions including manhattan distance, euclidean distance, and modular distance. we discussed where each technique is most applicable. for line fitting, we used euclidean distance and reviewed the derivation for estimating parameters (a, b). in the case of simple linear regression, we discovered a closed-form solution for these parameters.",-0.06733172,0.0017986292,-0.037918124,0.050995044,0.037802305,0.038128734,-0.025687452,0.03962091,0.069108136,0.03656498,0.068472244,-0.0539436,0.0035070272,-0.026729915,0.07107425,-0.07867557,0.010960819,-0.01072266,-0.00448191,0.05526391,0.078112476,-0.034436677,-0.004414633,0.05722396,-0.007037729,-0.02231683,-0.049193986,0.0028392335,0.024733437,0.04051208,0.07553727,0.051786594,0.06299071,-0.011858076,-0.036578685,-0.016015142,0.00802573,0.083440535,-0.021167492,0.07515607,0.01639086,-0.046353064,-0.03843481,0.07807477,0.04132686,0.06475103,-0.023910321,-0.007439052,-0.15069902,0.15790525,-0.027760983,0.08227967,0.00602531,0.010146821,-0.0076786648,-0.054097705,-0.02073724,-0.08676822,0.0029343194,-0.016080461,-0.08390969,-0.027278004,-0.010404633,-0.016306663,0.020457633,0.0062227105,-0.0021604018,-0.029154433,0.053902626,-0.022083996,-0.07157685,0.054819025,-0.013170947,0.11813044,-0.031139458,-0.11283239,-0.029059244,-0.00957176,0.03535109,0.022225011,0.038479846,0.03793917,-0.035520572,0.02829492,0.0037923101,0.0066550476,0.043106984,-0.007812975,-0.01680287,-0.04371819,-0.006952379,0.055423092,0.0012134125,0.05848423,0.0040907725,0.0046397294,-0.007869976,-0.003850585,0.1004596,0.019217674,0.013095088,0.063022874,0.01970349,-0.015261133,-0.080490634,-0.07130534,-0.025963882,-0.05618888,0.03980651,0.008163234,-0.026318226,0.012394576,-0.0400231,0.04304435,0.06783623,-0.13460317,0.006661591,0.009756575,0.029265566,-0.033495422,0.020690463,0.0019468678,-0.024229659,0.050819088,0.07184676,0.06507152,-0.004188314,3.7561585e-33,-0.06657644,-0.066883616,-0.04990669,0.08901392,-0.08022381,-0.01812848,-0.015068911,0.03642541,0.052386172,0.0834307,0.05027803,-0.049661465,-0.001498651,0.0939347,0.08501711,0.08738952,-0.003938204,0.053538,-0.0469054,0.0006561846,0.0066385283,0.077643044,0.04898559,0.030062191,0.0062634265,-0.0138524985,-0.03633684,0.027153265,-0.0014532817,-0.05024832,0.06121092,-0.055043027,-0.02655827,-0.0052534235,-0.016582651,-0.0074903877,0.060273323,-0.009800221,-0.034054548,0.021778356,0.0010566041,0.012297454,0.11223188,0.01722918,-0.002323099,-0.0148099605,-0.0111359395,0.029039018,-0.0005170115,0.019601898,-0.06807546,-0.04246343,-0.030930215,0.024413692,0.05137276,0.09405132,-0.10509038,-0.03728984,-0.09301091,0.041810077,-0.06408146,0.0071252417,0.056615423,-0.078676015,0.10179865,0.044191703,-0.0023525856,-0.029434513,0.058162384,-0.018964166,-0.005364035,-0.010642709,-0.13647036,0.06984715,-0.039852988,0.0065322495,0.049362365,0.0012805094,0.0088590495,0.04889365,-0.00050261756,-0.0105047105,-0.075065896,-0.023946503,-0.044141304,0.017564988,0.029974919,-0.079492964,0.057826754,-0.12704533,-0.048633635,-0.013237136,-0.13621697,-0.017697189,-0.044922955,-6.604635e-33,0.011059766,0.021528585,-0.017068064,0.07744061,-0.03508585,-0.01998518,0.024746483,-0.065681174,-0.020914083,-0.08781357,-0.13222107,0.024654958,0.055269204,0.008486896,0.0057134647,0.04289181,-0.07105065,-0.040324066,-0.093335375,0.013399837,-0.06656302,0.045340385,0.013091853,-0.044579204,-0.042332835,-0.00977273,-0.027935024,0.051998768,0.046274308,-0.06698306,0.007528332,-0.11223375,0.041679163,-0.10769827,-0.013096085,-0.00059549074,0.09695026,0.017487472,-0.040514924,0.027881894,-0.04739481,0.036621325,0.03703809,-0.048402313,-0.014904763,0.04853242,0.014818061,-0.018273797,-0.053580526,-0.049469344,0.038034856,0.04357905,-0.047913425,0.05885125,0.016810002,-0.055892117,-0.0504688,-0.08179684,-0.016146211,0.010254591,0.046531245,0.020174894,-0.110123664,0.061836805,-0.110556535,-0.007194882,0.031576518,-0.055737045,-0.06511876,-0.04518916,-0.0716912,-0.027504275,0.060084477,-0.031870652,-0.039252866,-0.10062573,-0.019536966,-0.015967434,-0.0062174224,-0.044759266,0.032002557,-0.08259766,-0.0072981087,-0.04409228,-0.06246938,-0.0014629799,0.09525733,0.006191667,-0.038711797,-0.029393276,-0.030278562,-0.009137167,-0.080725834,0.021952612,-0.027355887,-6.961329e-08,-0.038964003,0.10275803,0.07159533,-0.0152426455,-0.021746058,0.025850713,0.029353173,-0.031383388,-0.016878199,0.050983753,0.022794265,0.033837378,-0.04800275,-0.021742983,0.049307242,0.052480374,0.054343842,0.072622515,0.0030389829,0.031886276,0.01137266,-0.004492621,-0.08114337,-0.02420866,0.10701642,-0.034176096,0.025722826,0.07282507,0.016192082,0.038343165,-0.0115786325,0.05092682,0.07794222,-0.011164119,0.11343458,-0.016975874,-0.04170662,-0.057301406,0.084806636,-0.06229726,-0.04897462,0.02592826,-0.08672097,0.042751703,0.065771475,-0.021827597,0.011505894,-0.04304045,0.019231353,0.017337251,-0.005972564,-0.08510798,0.009482655,0.020410335,-0.0048634424,0.024498602,-0.032143228,-0.020217529,0.012789455,0.019215517,0.11362214,0.034591634,-0.008480695,-0.07215175,0,-28.81626,-9.850941,12
323,"in todayâ€™s class we learnt about simple linear regression and how we estimate the coefficients,  m and  c, using sample data. these coefficients define the regression line. we learnt that these values are only point estimates of the population parameters, which means they wonâ€™t exactly match the true population values but should be close. the confidence for that exact point will be 0%. however we can obtain an interval with a given confidence. it is called estimation interval or confidence interval. if we increase the size of interval, the confidence will increase too. example- for confidence of 100% the interval needs to be infinity like entire domain.
for sample we get those coefficient and we call it statistic. for population it is called parameter. our main aim is to obtain parameter based on statistic. for the regression line we also define an error term which can be calculated in multiple ways. we can either take absolute difference of all points from the line and sum it up. other way we could take the square of distances of point from line and sum it up. in this way the error is calculated for each point and we aim to minimize it to get those linear regression

348,"we started by talking about population v/s sample. we consider a sample and determine the various attributes associated with it, like- mean mode, median and based on the values of these attributes, we predict those for our population. so, it is important to consider a sample that is good and represents the population well. the attributes estimated for population are known as parameters, while those calculated using the sample data are called as estimates/ statistics. we talked about the different kinds of attributes that can be associated with the population data. some of these include- mean, median, mode, standard deviation. our goal is to estimate these parameters of the population using the calculated statistics. all levels of measurement can be assigned different attributes of the data, depending on the type of data they account for. for example, nominal level can have the attribute of mode or count(frequency) but assigning the attribute of mean would be completely senseless, as nominal data is qualitative.
then we started discussing simple linear regression. in this model, we fit the data using a line (a simple linear equation with just one independent variable).
we can always use a point to represent any data, but this choice is very naive. so we instead use a simple equation like: y=ax+b where a and b are the estimates of population parameters and x is the independent variable. the y intercept, b here represents the sum total of the effects of all â€˜unknownâ€™ independent variables, which are not considered in the equation. so, as we include more and more independent variables, the value of b would start decreasing. also, depending upon the chosen sample, we can have various values of a and b. so, every sample will have a unique value for a and b. these values- a and b are known as the point estimates of the actual parameters. we can say with 100% confidence that the values of these point estimates do not coincide with the actual parameter values. so, in order to establish a certain level of certainty about the parameter values, we convert the point estimates to interval estimates, thereby giving a confidence interval, within which the population parameters would lie, with a given level of certainty. as the length of confidence interval increases, we become more and more confident that the estimated values resemble the parameter values. now, since different samples would give us different values of the estimates, we need to determine the values, which minimize the error. error for an observation is defined as the difference between the actual value and that obtained by estimating the data set with a line. so, to find the values of a and b, we need to minimize the sum of squares of individual errors. we do this by partially differentiating the expression with respect to a and b separately and by solving the two equations for two unknowns, we get the values of a and b in terms of the means and the mean of squares of the data set values. after getting the values of a and b, we put them in the equation to obtain the best model for the given data set. we consider the squares while minimizing errors instead of simply minimizing their sum as- it magnifies the errors, also it prevents cancellation of the errors, which can result when one point is above the line and other is below. since, we are getting the exact values of a and b, these are known as â€˜closed-form solutionsâ€™.
we do observe that the means of x and y (all observed values) satisfy the equation of the regression line. so, the predicted/ approximated line for the data values, pass through their mean.

400,"learnt about population and sample.if not impossible then it will be very expensive to work with the data of entire population so we always study some parts of the population i.e. sample.our main objective is to estimate different parameters of the population based on the statistics that we obtained from our sample. there are various attributes associated to a data.for example if we have the data of marbles in the box then we can calculate frequency of particular colour balls,mean,median,mode,standard deviation,variance and also can perform certain operations like addition, subtraction,etc.we use different models like line,point depending on the data we have.point is considered a very naive model.
then took an example of simple linear regression(assuming only one predictor i.e. advertisement expenditure) to predict sales.for that the equation is y=b_0+b_1x where b_0 and b_1 of sample are point estimates of population parameters i e. we can claim with 0% confidence that b_0 and b_1 for population will be these values only.our aim is to find a confidence interval so that with good enough confidence we can claim that the values of b_0 and b_1 for the population will lie in that interval.the ""b_0"" term is called the 'bias' and it accounts for other factors that might affect sales so our natural intuition is that as we increase the number of predictor variables bias will decrease and if at all we can include all the predictor variables then bias will be zero.
lastly,we found out how to actually calculate this b_0 and b_1 of a given sample.we try to minimize the sum of the square of the errors where error is the distance between actual value and the value that we get from the line.one interesting thing that we got after the derivation was that mean of the predictor values and response values lie on the best fit line.",-0.038400345,-0.0091111185,-0.032023914,0.07531138,0.0068390057,0.043806598,0.012948743,0.042294227,0.06528825,-0.02948295,0.007420504,-0.058944244,0.08118429,-0.03831314,0.07568746,-0.05164035,0.07617657,0.014597639,-0.018878901,-0.0075751953,0.024840176,-0.016798198,-0.03212693,0.028648335,-0.07384192,-0.052987486,0.03278851,-0.050103884,-0.041797806,0.0032286118,0.04042393,-0.033005334,0.03745637,0.026269227,0.022349976,-0.096304685,-0.014457133,0.050121043,0.030530704,0.0034992585,-0.021896258,-0.03332574,0.006535239,0.05887367,0.08440318,0.014045638,0.07515886,0.067511566,-0.0021349657,0.08047369,-0.06687572,0.05753933,0.0017295987,-0.053557593,-0.019989207,-0.09820555,-0.03664221,-0.09921312,0.044005558,0.026457772,-0.012420938,-0.025424024,0.004983834,-0.03569139,-0.024103072,0.033487946,-0.043579984,0.034128554,-0.045388438,-0.0059257234,0.010578103,-0.0025402047,-0.0692984,0.040402714,-0.019774577,-0.03533704,0.005876046,-0.012904035,-0.05046412,0.05292421,0.043359548,0.013343038,-0.076568484,0.03167066,-0.029731594,-0.0024112628,0.024783108,0.078267336,-0.021820478,-0.037024297,-0.0023199457,0.060126252,-0.08318703,0.025923243,0.042770293,0.019053752,-0.032942295,-0.059413843,0.11177456,0.029018112,-0.023125755,0.007238,0.10002256,-0.043900218,-0.07176933,-0.0485054,-0.009732443,0.011079535,0.011658136,-0.012917914,-0.042425178,-0.08249513,-0.06419102,0.06944301,0.07584765,-0.09797814,-0.054465026,-0.08884477,-0.030976636,0.009539891,0.11789735,0.047530062,0.06683003,0.06914271,-0.007319976,0.039147522,-0.0688583,7.347106e-33,-0.1118047,-0.026700959,0.038512345,0.07420204,-0.06409694,0.023416078,-0.05330255,-0.0115110595,0.06945828,0.030765979,0.019803949,-0.120538846,0.013736546,0.022050947,0.1552906,0.08887928,0.044099476,-0.009447164,0.0077484143,0.09312447,-0.007732302,-0.059644863,0.020385556,0.019152174,-0.01502615,0.020959103,0.009162434,0.05548062,0.024847547,-0.02593052,0.07043185,0.021344036,-0.056243293,-0.050252806,-0.08744392,-0.057922732,-0.03210525,-0.019459834,-0.062036093,0.050092567,-0.002648707,0.01797281,0.070763394,0.09162711,0.033739064,0.031710997,-0.038502272,-0.017153412,-0.10028616,0.049777072,-0.032555267,0.030864261,-0.086374626,-0.03489347,-0.011308391,0.08361971,-0.08937649,-0.041730374,-0.041244213,-0.02406587,-0.08671348,-0.055829067,-0.008877988,-0.047613647,-0.019858541,0.0633746,0.012656963,-0.010323647,0.028866922,0.02282914,0.06142245,-0.055948947,-0.058815666,-0.025878858,-0.015403986,-0.016556779,0.042632613,0.027569484,0.033424303,-0.010519101,-0.011033283,-0.06461966,-0.0072331387,-0.038149167,0.0009155672,0.03971286,0.08139582,0.031238385,0.031088023,-0.045060325,-0.047574006,0.055975247,-0.18285574,0.04990669,-0.03567508,-7.899675e-33,-0.012810469,0.037412927,0.04600559,0.01726526,-0.048723303,0.056384735,-0.049900144,-0.087445535,0.04574695,-0.068449505,-0.11920717,0.03449991,0.10827787,0.05823123,-0.023588417,0.073459335,0.043859463,-0.04020075,-0.02291307,0.024615439,-0.04834845,0.010079427,-0.03861035,-0.047804683,-0.08780253,0.04343936,-0.15908691,0.07742087,-0.05504749,-0.06697184,-0.021808816,-0.0609883,0.035287663,-0.11612565,-0.027444648,0.09263099,-0.0114796525,0.042991474,0.004261568,0.05325561,0.0408596,-0.0109452065,-0.021338431,-0.09772555,-0.038575176,0.010180039,0.03655434,-0.036601525,0.0005753225,-0.013861143,-0.009436691,0.10264581,-0.04311638,-0.039437294,0.0011213743,-0.005682481,-0.05241083,0.0046685385,0.025941405,-0.005005163,-0.020561555,0.05120485,-0.09283851,0.12169975,0.016943892,-0.013996391,0.015672296,-0.05116243,0.039829984,-0.023487847,-0.04640745,0.021694794,0.06004247,0.006403746,-0.035964657,-0.025201587,-0.038478166,-0.017746802,0.040327743,-0.005107281,0.012095503,-0.0062652733,0.03913051,-0.048230793,-0.044761114,-0.03215944,0.04717294,0.04034693,0.004778596,-0.025292527,-0.064785235,0.017677696,-0.06561794,-0.060528062,0.07107263,-7.8940076e-08,-0.06284244,0.019544479,0.08869043,0.040676422,0.053272344,-0.019073974,0.0284282,-0.0068912315,0.01001039,0.009175935,-0.02348291,-0.03062125,-0.034356505,0.031931814,-0.04762245,0.11659835,0.032582194,0.035227172,0.018165043,0.039071143,-0.01169353,0.009843289,-0.025743462,0.0018606489,0.055666387,-0.040260486,0.01110965,0.03463745,0.023401568,0.10683517,-0.008949299,-0.09850697,0.02095606,0.0030939453,0.11413564,-0.056753304,-0.042022582,-0.035821,0.0013446248,-0.08317796,-0.00096620055,0.03879043,-0.06224972,0.008915207,0.12135784,-0.020913022,0.038789064,-0.034540895,-0.0063914615,0.025074586,0.018876417,0.0039918856,-0.0029958368,0.013616061,-0.058641385,0.034787383,-0.057578642,0.061528157,-0.018146288,0.04590957,0.014466387,0.015793797,-0.054932162,-0.0308915,0,-30.033157,-7.4700794,12
405,"we started the session by differentiating between sample and our population (or the universal data), and defined our goal which is predicting the population and trends existing within from the sample set. we looked at the different results and operations which can be performed on the data, attributes and when they are called parameters (if based on population) and when statistics (based on sample). we also looked at the simple linear regression (slr) and biases which exist within the system. biases are unexplained terms which influence the predictions and account for the missing parameters, not accounted for due to some error. if we account for all parameters then the prediction curve (or straight line) should pass from the origin. we then looked at point predictions, the confidence intervals and how their size affects the confidence percentage. following this and from the scatter plot, we saw the different types of error terms which can be formed, like the use of sum of modulus or sum of squares, spheres of influence and which one is more suitable. further we tried to calculate the formulae for the different parameters, basically their closed forms, and how it is not always possible to calculate them, in multivariate

430,"today we discussed simple linear regression (slr). simple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable y and an independent variable x by fitting a straight line to the data. the objective is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the squared difference between the observed data points and the predicted values. the simple linear regression model is represented by the equation: y=a+bx+ïµ. the goal is to estimate the parameters a, bâ€‹ in summary, simple linear regression finds the best-fitting straight line by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values, leading to the estimation of the slope and intercept.by minimizing the sum of squared errors, i.e., error - the difference between the observed values and actual values. to minimize the sse, take partial derivatives with respect to a, bâ€‹, set them to zero, and solve. after calculating a-hatâ€‹ and b-hatâ€‹, the fitted regression line is obtained.this is how we estimate the population parameters based on the data sample. we can also calculate confidence intervals on the parameter estimates using their known mean and variance.",-0.10775238,0.0172099,-0.012013648,0.11800202,0.008530567,0.05533162,-0.03876,0.093012154,0.0015663479,0.012558878,0.040023196,0.007330345,0.07209439,-0.027149802,-0.016827947,-0.043405738,-0.036959432,0.01243739,-0.025142204,-0.02712309,0.049040765,-0.017986074,-0.11841833,0.004128878,0.03509358,0.0065646106,-0.012496409,0.018535938,-0.06783278,0.038541205,0.027494313,-0.010274255,0.059240207,0.025585579,-0.06504196,-0.09826133,0.018622017,0.050462883,0.004952899,0.00030063934,-0.059846606,-0.03413851,-0.005319426,0.016561072,0.035723414,0.0013680857,0.020893177,-0.06919464,-0.07577733,0.0596248,0.005291657,-0.038724575,0.014249436,-0.031552978,0.05846322,-0.049981933,-0.024319004,-0.043943804,0.11643549,0.039952144,-0.017014034,-0.05657954,0.01224,0.01754947,0.0129815005,0.020352196,0.0008824517,-0.028024882,-0.013624119,0.025554953,-0.10669515,0.021050118,-0.08694409,0.0194888,-0.019392744,-0.09493005,0.06085425,0.058732565,-0.0052282177,0.041884594,0.017282045,0.028289082,0.0002894769,0.050352708,0.0106329415,0.035697505,0.038588624,-0.05338301,0.049713362,-0.003980217,-0.007700623,0.052907445,-0.057407144,0.072166644,-0.009774744,-0.005267418,-0.035866324,-0.04179032,0.009556186,0.028578544,-0.012701758,0.06817582,0.061753135,0.012663802,0.015432233,-0.011372494,0.055521432,-0.08562728,0.0072911186,0.022526035,-0.07590422,0.0063332953,-0.03754724,0.021368947,0.06258265,-0.08855708,0.037303332,0.020794434,0.0032568078,0.035724804,0.02950334,0.043781757,0.03977952,0.05033375,0.057053786,0.06843181,-0.0732198,5.6415996e-33,-0.047962014,0.013188085,0.015778113,0.012797913,-0.008747101,-0.06894432,-0.06656568,0.020542203,0.054341123,0.091614224,-0.028372591,-0.11546668,-0.046175577,0.040890448,0.08903081,0.05286884,-0.008020586,0.008964199,-0.04865454,0.053805985,-0.07387256,-0.07774192,0.11015527,-0.048269007,0.013225337,-0.017378103,0.08983516,0.0046259747,0.0009707554,-0.03126356,0.048815884,-0.061952125,0.0047876523,-0.06973584,-0.010450146,-0.071921386,0.064433046,-0.00773767,-0.024230195,0.07178205,0.025779765,0.08403842,0.08145335,-0.034646433,0.047020633,0.056667473,-0.018088212,0.026715776,0.031435177,0.040778838,-0.11898711,0.009157917,-0.08224927,0.057603568,-0.01585245,0.09982123,-0.07636695,-0.028458973,-0.05586862,0.04214261,-0.057743285,-0.024939507,0.026173178,-0.09223046,0.072814174,0.06909892,0.015861876,0.02537343,-0.009439688,-0.0024883242,-0.030826943,-0.06888998,0.041589618,0.020879608,0.0364257,-0.027481228,0.02447529,-0.019256724,0.09278547,-0.048629694,-0.008969016,0.09732213,-0.069164984,-0.09170063,-0.0698954,-0.04202211,-0.005623383,-0.045485348,-0.05010502,-0.07129741,-0.0881251,0.03235124,-0.093622945,0.035578612,-0.003678795,-6.183415e-33,0.00037027997,0.026163109,0.017673574,0.020308688,-0.030626917,0.0020378726,0.042244032,-0.0320205,0.090691224,0.028856862,-0.034978073,-0.027375283,-0.01357932,0.06257764,0.069040954,0.05874889,0.008085719,-0.07996451,-0.0076037846,-0.015135452,0.012116024,0.016929928,0.0033414678,-0.035628323,-0.03139703,-0.01148665,-0.017770847,0.13903907,-0.05909499,-0.07324247,-0.016012091,-0.0015505995,-0.06269517,-0.12453654,-0.10410984,0.06951296,-0.046428658,0.038906988,0.0033066168,-0.021476902,-0.0042890417,0.05783936,0.035008833,-0.13604651,0.016579088,0.057594676,0.027258849,-0.015306035,0.0029074484,-0.058388177,0.006626302,0.06423019,-0.07089951,0.05650269,-0.0023815066,-0.063446864,-0.08219748,-0.027413152,-0.034415107,-0.04383665,0.025137022,0.00014997361,-0.09675399,0.07505269,-0.06194752,0.05177921,-0.0004051724,-0.06928149,0.05241901,-0.032202892,-0.0002493111,-0.0054469495,0.06960606,0.038200688,-0.040822357,-0.09296336,-0.040416133,-0.05779967,0.008058997,-0.015738988,0.04886563,-0.020752095,0.037310116,-0.08505172,-0.02239729,-0.019596027,0.013986722,0.050960492,0.034450654,-0.013422834,-0.12503417,0.014538654,-0.047932945,-0.003954703,-0.031663027,-6.612538e-08,-0.07827457,0.0024033117,0.023089692,0.010342675,0.005719353,0.0075783166,0.03738068,-0.005235151,-0.018328976,-0.040838733,0.010890521,0.043920696,-0.05205142,0.046402864,-0.015711531,0.09562407,0.02844662,0.063748606,0.03531451,0.0013084853,0.02918762,0.011853657,-0.08119425,0.017044589,0.121924974,-0.05327634,0.029537551,0.14811198,0.0029105842,0.066644154,-0.0018200703,-0.0011714322,0.07393025,-0.023369683,0.0741127,0.024660962,0.024962427,-0.02059493,0.06413496,0.001822851,-0.022191478,0.07728128,-0.056470618,-0.010926675,0.0848234,0.01874681,0.092337675,-0.07158443,0.021093836,-0.099846974,0.1223056,-0.06654962,-0.021985129,0.029909197,-0.054500785,-0.01840186,-0.020132575,0.004518837,-0.018809997,0.024553582,0.0026134572,0.033922978,0.0072767544,-0.043073174,0,-23.917202,-10.58529,12
435,"population vs sample, sample is a subset of population. we also learned that which statistics measure can be used in which of the level of measurement.
if we estimate, for population, than it is called a parameter and in case of sample, when we calculate, it is called statistic. before applying any ml techniques, we should first gain a basic knowledge about the data which is usually done by a scatter plot. we learnt about the simple linear regression, where there is only one predictor. generally, in slr, we take y as the dependent variable and x as the independent variable. we also say that the y intercept on slr is called bias. here we find that b0 and b1 are estimates of parameters of the population. to take account of error, we define a confidence interval. if we have a large confidence, then our interval will be large and vice versa.
to provide uniformity in all the directions of errors, we take sigma ei^2 instead of sigma |ei|. we also discussed about the derivation of the parameters for linear regression where we minimixe the sigma (ei)^2",-0.080328286,-0.0070050103,-0.04444935,0.07011175,0.047286324,0.0260009,0.020639157,0.046593882,0.022706185,0.029256143,0.04979414,-0.0031409604,0.056837093,-0.06469846,0.042815123,-0.019599,0.046635505,-0.023546852,-0.06157792,-0.024435665,0.023026444,-0.0062438594,-0.009439955,0.042500976,0.0024088505,-0.04954645,-0.0054318984,-0.0037306445,-0.0053027053,0.007206921,0.08288304,0.01878778,0.067751125,-0.0028121416,-0.03643022,-0.055222873,-0.012146652,0.03079228,0.03751117,0.042904273,0.018395126,-0.013377978,-0.016260328,0.049518984,0.028116465,0.043312415,-0.02649143,0.001967112,-0.05326721,0.097700134,-0.0034253486,-0.0051362165,0.0075570396,0.0019863092,-0.004292736,-0.05914463,-0.049123522,-0.035449356,0.0903897,0.048562143,-0.034451734,-0.022642057,-0.00927186,0.003265527,0.032015346,0.0072237765,0.029517312,-0.004866383,-0.004830829,0.0135724,-0.087259166,0.025299247,-0.12176272,0.05059625,-0.022342093,-0.06397514,0.03577633,0.028337382,0.010514787,0.030374583,0.06915733,0.04307558,0.033858657,0.058951184,0.027667232,-4.6619483e-05,0.0076976484,-0.021779658,-0.0029019276,-0.03816277,-0.0077234046,-0.010704243,-0.06512025,0.054444116,-0.014799973,0.008632834,-0.052115608,-0.017961204,0.09118241,0.03901916,-0.050802182,0.028209703,0.045378916,0.024463188,-0.03812445,-0.091365166,0.040657967,-0.040640034,0.016321126,0.03341336,-0.005821075,0.028493358,-0.039744675,0.086503744,0.08000354,-0.15825377,0.01745292,0.034676164,-0.071871035,-0.010585648,0.06697339,0.059027366,0.00045903938,0.019841507,0.014240636,0.030094657,-0.060539678,2.3976187e-33,-0.00057540985,-0.026476622,-0.035076223,0.08844524,-0.047004156,-0.041659195,-0.03843931,0.030761031,0.012156563,0.062723316,0.017648935,-0.09307005,0.020515652,0.07102307,0.09025297,0.1126505,-0.0086452905,0.036117747,-0.026461491,0.03426405,0.0067257,-0.031493187,0.041636027,-0.036250886,-0.03549156,-0.0050498,0.04520471,0.055239305,-0.018603297,-0.033259008,0.013705046,-0.032020982,0.007850494,-0.023506634,-0.0023753066,-0.007837034,0.030682432,-0.012342967,-0.05670504,0.0621785,-0.012543424,0.060763434,0.09348519,0.025420327,0.042437896,0.0049906126,-0.02257543,-0.028118096,0.05420068,0.0033681844,-0.0898912,-0.0074048107,-0.038933348,0.05771594,0.042632982,0.10631478,-0.07045284,-0.03925642,-0.07095095,0.051562734,-0.03406345,-0.018741967,0.010664448,-0.042529345,0.07976428,0.09754838,-0.004388132,0.007367567,-2.444407e-05,-0.022256173,0.013647385,-0.055010974,-0.062847294,0.07449651,-0.04507483,-0.010118253,0.0052552014,-0.0069533787,0.050493505,0.013194912,-0.014576808,-0.022922937,-0.13734488,-0.050314516,-0.0967212,-0.024200693,0.012641309,-0.042626403,0.05569923,-0.058281895,-0.043103017,-0.017345408,-0.12875755,0.00010919134,-0.06273401,-4.5425484e-33,0.013041208,0.026096344,0.02680488,0.041645367,-0.08073342,-0.0077187424,0.10750497,-0.07589247,0.019307056,0.0029019527,-0.095172636,-0.010951955,0.029285176,0.09585737,0.028640024,0.03603608,-0.0024589181,-0.055511907,-0.07333042,-0.023639493,0.016405351,0.056817587,0.039457448,-0.07657174,-0.025013426,-0.0047935527,-0.038095906,0.11640727,-0.01903818,-0.08498967,-0.023641493,-0.081014514,-0.008859006,-0.12271534,-0.017243471,0.09988344,0.043455757,0.057662882,-0.012726066,-0.03762247,-0.029824898,0.013113234,0.028424194,-0.08199644,0.010620002,0.033628758,0.022057591,0.005446162,0.013806194,-0.06570513,0.008758929,0.044927597,-0.032279313,0.08854393,-0.04265467,-0.09550572,-0.055439834,-0.059218317,-0.02332934,0.02602902,-0.0013771037,0.021120891,-0.10062625,0.076809056,-0.11074803,0.038024772,0.017619135,-0.07946928,0.043875024,-0.026354533,-0.05481291,-0.039044756,0.07726842,0.000866455,-0.059241246,-0.053181432,-0.07674399,-0.05662242,-0.033995155,-0.04210147,0.01157111,-0.087982625,0.013535408,-0.049872,-0.0426285,-0.0727963,0.062511116,-0.01473955,-0.008982607,-0.07785175,-0.0715648,-0.017691674,-0.02638256,-0.021808553,-0.026850801,-6.629167e-08,-0.07298192,0.092504114,0.07527629,0.008924939,0.008362429,0.0016986704,0.0034438313,-0.09026528,-0.013480133,0.04099527,0.0049418546,0.06755262,-0.0471238,-0.03980428,0.029551461,0.107404724,0.0047452766,0.06715629,0.03807862,0.008926194,0.013800278,-0.032877557,-0.041647602,-0.041334346,0.13776226,-0.037599422,-0.02072161,0.10976982,0.034581922,0.0258749,-0.0033010407,-0.001165176,0.08616223,-0.006675709,0.14559068,-0.021968352,-0.011552369,-0.057800468,0.0988934,-0.031253777,-0.028491093,0.05115886,-0.05322267,0.028160946,0.08708459,0.021817375,-0.008774344,-0.008155767,-0.003675219,-0.035530787,0.078929916,-0.11294288,0.026666667,0.094748616,-0.01459213,0.024679514,-0.012980257,-0.033749104,-0.015542808,0.07816566,0.062270097,0.13227436,-0.034595493,-0.08987151,0,-27.619064,-8.347196,12

456,"population v/s sample: the quality of a sample is measured by how well it represents the population. once we have a sample, we need to predict the population from the sample.

there are various attributes like mean, median, mode and various operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication etc.  

depending on the level of measurement ,we can or cannot calculate certain attributes or perform certain operations.

any variable measured for the sample is deemed as a statistic whereas any variable measured for the population is deemed as a parameter.

simple linear regression: fitting a best fit line through the set of data to try to model it accurately.

the type of model to fit is highly dependent on how the data is spread. for a circular distribution, a point may also seem like a valid model but it is a little naive and inaccurate to do so.

a simple linear regression has one dependent and one independent variable where y=b0+b1*(x).the coefficients b0 and b1 are calculated so that the resulting line is best fitted to the given data. we try to find a confidence interval around b0 and b1 so that we can confidently say that a large fraction(most of the data) lies within that interval.the error is the difference between the predicted y value and the ctual y value and the sum of squares of errors is minimized in what is known as the least squares fitting method.

503,"in today's lecture we discussed about sample and population differences, we discussed about statistics i.e. when the data is calculated for the sample and it is called parameter when it is calculated for the population. we can find the parameters (estimation) using linear regression to find the best fit line for the data. the equation of this best fit (regression) line is y = b0 + b1x, where b0,b1 are parameters. we also discussed on how to find the confidence interval for these parameter's estimates and using the sum of squares method to minimize the error. in this squares method we use sum of squares of (errors) distances as the errors can be +ve or -ve so directly the sum won't give minimum error as sum can be minimsed from -ve values of errors which may be of greater absolute values.
so now we will minimize this summation ei ^2    by partially differentiating w.r.t. b0 and b1. this will help us to determine the estimates of the parameters for the data, where ei = error = (yi- b0 + b1x). hence we get the final estimated values of these parameters as:
b0 = [mean(y)- b1 * mean(x)    and   b1 = mean(x*y) - mean(x)*mean(y)] / [mean(x^2)- (mean(x))^2]

517,"in today's lecture, we started the discussion with population vs sample that the sample must be good and representative of the entire population. we use the sample to predict/estimate various attributes of the population.

attributes of population:
1. count (frequency)
2. mode
3. mean
4. median
5. standard deviation
6. variance

operations:
1. count
2. add
3. subtract
4. multiply
5. divide

if these attributes are calculated from the population they are known as parameters and if they are calculated from a sample they are known as statistic.
we want to estimate the parameters based on the statistics.

slr -> simple linear regression:
(it has only one predictor) 

we find the best fit line for the given data in the slr model.
y = b0 + b1x
where, y -> dependent variable, response variable, label
             x -> independent variable, feature, predictor

even a point can be considered as a model - although a very naive model.

here, b0 is called as bias as it accounts for all the other features which we didn't account for in the model.
b0 and b1 are the estimates of the population parameters (i.e. statistics).
since these are calculated from the sample their confidence is very low. so, we need to find a confidence interval containing these estimates in which we can confidently say that the real population parameters would lie in.
on increasing the interval width, the confidence also increases.

we have y(hat) = ax+b, for each data value we define error ei = yi - yi(hat).
now to get the best fit line we need to minimize the errors.
for that taking the sum of all the individual errors won't work as the positive and negative errors might get cancelled leading to zero net error even if the individual error values are large.
to address this issue we can minimize the sum of either |ei| or (ei)^2. 
we prefer the sum of (ei)^2 as:
1. it magnifies the error for a better fit.
2. it doesn't differentiate between different directions.

summation(ei)^2 = summation(yi - yi(hat))^2 
                               = summation (yi - ax -b)^2
here, we can minimize the error by making the derivative of error zero with respect to both a and b to get their values.
we have 'closed form' solution to calculate the values of a and b.
we can also observe from the equations that the point with average values of features as x-coordinate and average values of labels as y-coordinate lies on the best fit line.

b0 and b1 are 'point estimates' so we need to arrive at the possible interval within which these values lie such that there is a very high chance that b0p and b1p (i.e. the population parameters) will lie within these intervals respectively.

519,"the lecture started with brief discussion on differences between population and samples. further we moved on with discussion on simple linear regression further discussing dependent and independent variables and via examples we learnt to plot scatter plots in order to gain insights of the data points and even used a point to model a collection of data. further we discussed liner regression in more detail talking about beta 1 and beta 0 which are used as estimates of population variables to gain insights about the data through an example of sales and advertisement as how sales depend on advertisement. the concept of bias was also introduced which accounts for independent variables/predictors which are not considered while modeling for the data. later the concept of error was introduced and the optimisation of beta 1 and beta 0 was carried out to get values a and b which is called a closed form solution. a concept of confidence intervals was also introduced briefly which is better than point estimates as of possible values of variables is given in terms of intervals with a specific confidence related to them.

529,"we learnt to estimate population parameters using sample statistics as samples are representative set of the population. depending on the data, models, like line and point, are employed. linear regression is used as an example to predict sales, with b0 and b1 being parameters for prediction of the population characteristics. then, learnt to find a confidence interval by minimizing the b0

531,"in today's session, we learn about the difference between sample and population. the variables in population are known as parameters and we use statistics on samples to estimate these parameters. there are various models and methods to estimate the parameters based on the type of data. the estimated function can be simple or difficult depending on the attributes. after estimating the parameters we give a confidence interval i.e how sure we are on the estimates we have provided. the estimates are generally range of values of a and b and larger the range higher is the confidence interval.
one such model was linear regression, where the best-fit representation is a straight line of the form y=a+ b*x where a and b are point estimates.
'a' is also known as bias which represents for all other variables/attributes we haven't taken into account. in linear regression we minimise the sum of square of errors as minimising the   sum of errors does not give accurate measurement. we also don't take absolute values of error as it is having manhattan distance and square area of influence. using this model we can interpolate this to predict the output based on the provided input with a given error limit.

542,"sir started with the topic â€œpopulation vs. sampleâ€. sample should be good and representative. probably the two should mean the same thing. using the sample we predict/estimate certain characteristics of the population. 
analysing the entire population to understand its behaviour/characteristics is not feasible both â€“ time wise and money wise. so, we make use of (representative) samples.
attributes
attributes associated with samples as well as population are:
1.	count (frequency)
2.	mode
3.	mean
4.	standard deviation
5.	variance, and many others
operations
operations associated with samples as well as population are:
1.	count
2.	add
3.	subtract
4.	multiply
5.	divide and many others
then sir asked us to make a table which contains attributes and operations associated with each of the four levels of measurement.

using a sample, we can estimate the mean of the population.
attributes associated with the population are known as parameters while those associated with the sample as statistics.
we want to estimate the parameters based on the statistics.
sir then showed us a scatter plot (between sales and advertising expenditure) and presented a case of simple linear regression. simple linear regression has only one predictor.
y is the response variable/dependent variable/label
x is the predictor variable/independent variable/feature
sir was then showing us a scatter plot in which it looked like the points were scattered on the surface of a circular disc. then he pointed out a few things, which are:
1.	simple linear regression is not required in such cases.
2.	it would not be the best possible method in such cases.
3.	but if someone wants to apply it, then it can be applied.
4.	in such a case a point is a better approximation than a line, this can be understood by taking any value of the feature (x) and then by looking at the difference in its actual value at that x and the predicted value.
5.	each point can be considered as a model â€“ although a very naã¯ve one.

now sir started talking about bias which is the value of the y â€“ intercept in the equation obtained by simple linear regression. he said bias is the net some of all un-accounted variables. so, if we develop such a model in which we have taken into account all the variables which affect the dependent variable (y) then we would obtain an equation which would pass through the origin. 

then he said that as the size of the sample which we are using to estimate the population parameters increases the estimates become better. think of this by thinking that if the entire population is the sample, then the estimates would be exactly equal to the parameters, if we decrease the size of this sample by some amount then the new estimates would be lesser good estimates than they were previously. now keeping on decreasing the size of the sample and think about the estimatesâ€™ reliability (it decreases). prediction error would increase.

then sir talked about estimation interval or confidence interval. he said that finding î²0 and î²1 was just the start of machine learning. we need to take into account the error that would be there in our estimation. we have no basis to say that î²0 = î²0p.
then he gave the definition of confidence interval which is that with a% probability we can say that the parameter value will lie in an interval, that interval is known as confidence interval. typically, confidence intervals are of 90% or 95% and sometimes even 99%. 100% confidence interval is the interval from -infinity to +infinity.
then sir talked about how to define the best fit line. now there were four options:
1.	minimize sum of all ei
2.	minimize the sum of squares of all ei.
3.	minimize the sum of perpendicular distance between all pairs of {(xi,,yi) and (xi,yi-bar)}.
4.	minimize the sum of absolute value of all ei.
here ei = yi â€“ (yi-bar)    
(1) is rejected (4) is rejected because we donâ€™t want our solutions to be biased towards any direction so we choose (2).
a professor sir/maâ€™am from iit kanpur has done (3).
now refer sirâ€™s linear regression derivation and from there we see that the equation of the line that is obtained after (2) is such that the point made up of the mean of the labels and features lies on that line.
now for more notes about this class refer class notes, sirâ€™s lecture notes and simple linear regression proof. 
it would be better if one read them from these 3 places.",0.011291425,-0.0004923363,-0.032916218,0.029080471,0.005549021,0.057132892,0.028324338,0.055146966,-0.018737521,0.020786295,0.07050752,-0.09107593,0.055831958,0.023719432,0.04216873,-0.0076383194,0.035705432,-0.034200672,-0.010671754,0.014195405,0.09852975,-0.038520325,0.055213388,0.009888544,-0.033445988,0.009523219,-0.025695466,-0.007155995,-0.012994503,-0.013564722,0.059376307,0.062696315,0.07325977,-0.008262251,-0.033561833,-0.06720788,0.044683278,0.07952079,0.010083777,0.07868606,-0.042255856,-0.02847393,0.018886128,0.02933861,0.032188382,-0.00682646,0.02510468,0.028538726,-0.04283989,0.12012505,-0.03668431,0.07108571,-0.0068704393,-0.026459642,0.049734876,-0.039060626,-0.003919314,-0.0917921,0.026308594,0.010564853,-0.04843758,-0.01671363,-0.024025308,-0.024098743,0.04535544,0.061263807,-0.073567644,0.04557875,-0.045453906,0.061601624,-0.010567862,0.002717896,-0.06753885,0.038638476,-0.024594057,-0.029927172,-0.07670581,-0.003292959,-0.0035346446,-0.030094737,0.044155937,0.013367486,-0.11668152,0.048662346,0.01200385,0.016585384,0.011013697,-0.06610042,-0.052591987,-0.036032207,0.020419316,0.08932133,-0.010652198,0.02381938,0.022128493,0.04325687,0.024446115,-0.092522524,0.14974281,0.048657257,-0.013160652,0.044223204,0.043845985,0.030990537,-0.15155946,-0.10232719,7.1862814e-05,0.030251255,-0.021199165,0.019865429,-0.07734994,-0.04618448,-0.118643045,0.043486226,0.06442692,-0.061767343,-0.03438736,-0.031648774,-0.048413478,-0.020452626,0.058567785,0.061505068,0.0365106,0.06374925,0.057643645,0.046077475,-0.020716868,7.028553e-33,-0.07910273,-0.009467197,-0.033554066,0.065853424,-0.049113017,-0.013764013,-0.009372172,0.021582726,0.083383724,0.060372278,0.031886376,0.012177827,-0.033375584,0.080844074,0.111638226,0.050185405,0.039128438,0.0823634,-0.059514,-0.02152964,-0.029322986,0.04728109,0.02830411,0.06736317,0.017021755,-0.021974755,0.013301633,0.047396727,0.050674405,0.017028127,0.09736411,-0.0006712281,-0.04511543,-0.082494244,-0.03223333,-0.05648749,0.042672887,-0.024758358,0.014206048,0.04979189,-0.0020624886,0.0055378834,0.102291584,0.006319017,-0.045658827,0.05443092,0.00115658,0.015093524,0.033460125,0.099126786,-0.04591726,-0.06769563,0.011441444,0.03326991,-0.018460046,0.08370056,-0.110058546,-0.046503555,-0.06798943,-0.008393432,-0.07190336,-0.03236837,0.031324394,-0.110501476,0.023394126,0.031658247,-0.02531495,-0.029830648,0.04658365,0.032021638,0.0468498,0.006189845,-0.11450838,0.027170276,0.009232589,0.009447529,0.013794091,0.064583115,-0.035416726,-0.015130354,-0.007898229,0.007809457,-0.08788922,-0.055108346,0.0011345327,0.041123062,0.10053563,-0.04662498,0.028806372,-0.013931181,-0.0035269605,0.03867858,-0.111401044,0.028685862,-0.061801497,-7.757704e-33,-0.04046345,0.13310988,0.06628432,0.017660012,0.014816603,0.031959318,-0.017016273,-0.078697965,0.030201564,-0.033895127,-0.16793491,-0.02553922,0.035436925,0.01719472,0.007038438,0.08213925,-0.009566955,-0.069297545,-0.04186285,-0.025319036,-0.07645129,0.044551022,-0.0005508996,-0.055419557,-0.05806261,0.033762224,-0.096249126,0.028304918,0.050421305,-0.07735648,-0.042364802,-0.08628849,-0.0040243836,-0.047474764,-0.031530272,0.027067076,0.06612292,0.0064491,0.0057634218,-0.058722813,0.02749064,0.0034370378,0.01458801,-0.0652169,0.028053593,-0.011743108,0.039364953,0.009284191,0.014260006,-0.037593782,-0.027322235,0.055679265,-0.044678573,-0.023920408,-0.058377642,-0.022977287,0.054393023,-0.037058007,-0.011251003,-0.0106975455,0.007826116,0.041678887,-0.07186861,0.0040436247,-0.025776848,-0.037634205,0.065637365,-0.11952749,-0.028235368,-0.02528422,-0.09975098,-0.08635632,0.0767946,-0.060018532,0.0077222777,-0.07196942,-0.15457962,0.014433497,-0.007714743,0.008899728,-0.04118375,-0.0038403352,0.032487057,-0.0932259,-0.07136745,-0.06517722,0.045500867,-0.008169604,-0.023099042,0.003913437,-0.043859582,0.011692714,-0.07636469,0.028845692,0.07953561,-7.409206e-08,-0.0022335916,0.0012581376,0.09045978,0.041746095,0.03037194,0.019930316,-0.012022721,0.023730855,0.041949082,0.01459377,0.01826033,0.0024810499,-0.075812355,0.05984888,-0.05875372,0.047984824,-0.04241859,0.01750056,-0.057328288,-0.014268678,0.029113345,0.004983472,-0.038473547,0.003562385,0.05596363,-0.03385839,-0.010406048,0.02609039,-0.0022542472,0.034444947,-0.023540866,0.0034549579,-0.008847981,-0.017472776,0.03434708,-0.075613685,-0.025441546,-0.025871843,0.04004414,0.013604141,0.0021955601,-0.026752615,-0.07208507,0.050415922,0.16654488,-0.0108778635,-0.022449508,-0.010011027,0.028756985,-0.027663426,-0.015088923,-0.13786536,0.0048987633,0.03124045,-0.05957303,0.0069204075,-0.038334616,0.03596215,0.033927172,-0.008012683,0.048996728,0.05567021,-0.061284,-0.03367029,0,-30.611917,-10.427639,12

today's class covered the concepts of population and sample data, with an emphasis on the practicality of using samples to estimate population parameters. key statistical measures such as mean, median, and variance were discussed, as well as their use in data analysis. confidence intervals were created to estimate population parameters with a certain level of certainty. the discussion then shifted to simple linear regression, in which we found the best-fit line by minimizing the sum of squared errors. we discovered that the mean of the predictor and response variables is on the best-fit line. deriving coefficients b0 and b1â€‹ for simple regression is straightforward, but extending this to multiple predictors requires more advanced algorithms, which will be explored in the following

603,"in this lecture, we learn about simple linear regression, what are parameters and statistics, how to find the coefficients bo and b1 in the prediction line y=mx+c. also both the mean of observations line on the prediction line. to find the prediction line, we have to minimize the sum of square of the errors sse. error = distance between the predicted label (from prediction line)and the actual label(from data). attributes calculated from sample are called statistic (e.g, mean, meadian, mode, sd, etc of sample), using this we try to predict/estimate the same for the entire population. different level of measurements  have different attributes and operations to be performed on the data. no one can say that the attributes of sample are exactly same as that of population with 100% confidence. if we took a point estimatie instead of prediction line or anyother possible bestfitted curve, the confidence is likely to be 0%.thus here come the importance of confidence interval(higher ci leads to larger ranges). also, we learned about what is bias (c-intercept of prediction line). bias accounts for the influences of all unknown variables on the  label(y). bias is zero only when we known the system entire, we know all the independent variables and their influence on the dependent variable.",-0.11153188,0.06263032,-0.027134933,0.11566685,0.097637065,0.053502806,0.045020387,0.100406356,0.05047663,0.026611723,-0.028682537,-0.063706234,0.09316855,-0.024233593,-0.009274403,-0.053801432,0.010591374,-0.027538177,-0.07108405,-0.027443105,0.014150622,0.0144207105,-0.022933336,0.049847987,0.020227397,-0.020863563,-0.034467816,0.024765272,-0.05863266,0.014501157,0.029501958,-0.011728603,0.06352227,-0.04283489,-0.068755835,-0.041673947,0.030417264,0.032232728,0.045702744,0.015446985,0.009171244,0.0204976,0.061698105,0.12493209,0.032362778,0.016714958,0.06927683,-0.06395076,-0.08732733,0.054580495,-0.0568735,-0.012958629,-0.032249298,-0.05485962,-0.023655016,-0.028347496,0.013611472,0.012039248,0.03580439,0.03320764,-0.043825347,-0.088309065,-0.008721814,0.00122519,-0.0064955424,-0.027382052,-0.0047628363,0.0023817332,-0.08112024,-0.04026013,-0.029054536,0.055212703,-0.102396615,0.037198123,0.071292944,0.003787156,0.040773183,0.08389684,-0.03727527,0.038162097,-0.0018748109,0.04017485,0.005158107,0.069892414,-0.015234655,0.013895081,-0.011950108,-0.0226338,-0.011662821,-0.01272301,0.06995211,-0.02396949,-0.110840105,0.05719848,0.01219282,0.055773437,-0.043792564,-0.033536516,0.01795764,0.020216778,-0.04171147,0.0493447,0.04627805,0.030398142,0.0111248,-0.026533553,0.06706999,-0.076654606,0.0025019448,0.011734358,-0.0353884,-0.07614714,-0.020868024,0.052954365,0.085372254,-0.06534468,-0.059373617,-0.0062851002,-0.06550425,-0.012173967,0.020345436,0.020877542,0.055675644,0.05096079,0.03521671,0.043899253,-0.07400936,5.1234983e-33,-0.0044696503,0.018983122,0.044942424,0.01893968,-0.033505123,-0.06355724,-0.07936212,-0.0105982255,0.1313217,0.040910695,-0.025819119,-0.11634417,0.00675098,0.02101077,0.11155752,0.09745484,0.01850266,0.037855186,-0.050920762,0.024590284,-0.0076630674,-0.0007454562,0.0405106,-0.05584866,0.005404119,0.0010327622,0.033216197,0.09121866,-0.08651049,-0.016542701,-0.012703346,-0.0072557195,0.053147078,-0.051572103,0.014121219,-0.045228843,0.027082104,-0.023048462,0.0032532495,0.080396116,0.048445437,0.060347095,0.05811788,-0.013335648,0.044481516,-0.037860014,-0.08418004,0.017786274,0.024056844,0.070859574,-0.07403127,-0.009123672,-0.018467337,0.012172188,-0.008244093,0.13447012,-0.09675042,-0.00911099,-0.058444165,-0.044186212,-0.062248252,-0.035753265,-0.019909617,-0.097203545,0.018974008,0.09099776,0.010515745,0.012359639,0.049551483,0.006370261,0.034061898,-0.07057731,-0.09023683,0.00700979,0.069408044,-0.01253212,-0.00732125,0.008828678,0.046688538,-0.03898193,-0.050067637,0.06257023,-0.13291606,-0.06151125,-0.07641827,-0.039160445,0.073848,-0.00039959996,0.01540849,-0.024532199,-0.027820198,-0.022790495,-0.099182375,0.022695495,-0.09176227,-6.606271e-33,-0.030976333,-0.015224706,0.029346986,-0.03526659,-0.052625954,-0.035370767,0.0027629004,-0.04944054,0.032504473,-0.05426406,-0.0531538,-0.01735418,-0.017090674,0.043829728,0.038685694,0.0664332,-0.025195248,-0.027327862,0.010944817,-0.047812127,0.05548571,-0.032806776,0.008258614,-0.016581258,-0.038184203,-0.010721333,-0.063101575,0.10809874,0.009874164,-0.08738278,-0.027120613,-0.048635483,-0.03225087,-0.07713441,-0.054217193,0.06305306,-0.00896065,0.062397245,-0.004589099,0.014076103,0.012179377,0.011423534,0.02222968,-0.12993126,-0.026168067,0.023859486,0.058339987,-0.06310873,0.007902856,-0.05479261,0.027219016,0.04561006,-0.052115735,0.050410576,-0.06307845,-0.06231972,-0.03191699,0.0375679,0.01929812,0.010117018,0.05324258,0.015331613,-0.11155276,0.077423826,-0.044642214,0.06482411,-0.04259142,-0.0518498,0.06310522,-0.0073871515,-0.024834415,-0.029835334,0.038088094,-0.0031258971,-0.06678236,-0.049602684,-0.052838523,-0.035487786,-0.041580245,0.028292645,-0.0074175475,0.0060865716,-0.0071583563,-0.081768915,-0.0019630925,0.011730647,0.023185834,0.07215996,0.015497359,-0.076851904,-0.08097065,0.02805579,-0.048860457,-0.0046231872,-0.021163005,-7.13588e-08,-0.09490194,0.018414931,0.07188249,0.047233954,-0.039432142,0.01515161,-0.0009187568,-0.009312565,-0.023125784,0.063008785,0.029001044,0.052529797,-0.084846966,0.0089145545,0.04537009,0.0809288,-0.017497972,0.059223153,0.038296454,0.010081076,0.05205007,-0.063012265,-0.06817214,-0.046642628,0.09635363,-0.08314524,0.024891589,0.12020741,0.017361235,0.057303518,-0.013362683,-0.04393345,0.07871395,-0.007085202,0.08417673,-0.01151824,0.03553207,-0.06170377,0.050292723,0.004877038,-0.013179381,0.03944521,-0.017897809,0.004305328,0.10482529,-0.04444787,0.0795344,0.08322451,0.028359741,-0.110376194,0.041778166,-0.077895634,-0.008129911,0.03285696,-0.0004392557,0.010170444,-0.0022376461,0.028095892,-0.047143042,0.074322194,0.040749375,0.06655903,0.02149166,-0.066438004,0,-25.995308,-8.759436,12
623,today we learnt about qualities of a sample that it should be representative of the population. the main funda of calculation on the sample is statistics and estimation on population is parameter. certain statistics on mean are count mode std dev median and mean etc. where we also made a tabulation of level of measurement and their attributes possible and operations allowed. then we moved on to simple linear regression. also an interesting thing that points are also fitting of data...though a bad fit as it's like cr of a class of data. we learnt about bias in a slr which indicates the effect of other parameters on the y or output. last part was derivation of linear fitting line with best fit condition to minimize error

643,"in today's class, we saw that the sample we selected for testing out of the population must be good and representative. the attributes we calculate for the sample are called statistics, and those we estimate for the population are called parameters. we estimate parameters based on the statistics. if y is a dependent/response variable, which is dependent on x as independent variables, features, or predictors and we have their sample data then we can predict a model through which we can find y for values of x that were not in the sample data, i.e. we are predicting population attributes using sample attributes. if there are various dependent variables, like x1,x2, etc. we can estimate the model using mlr while for only x we can predict the model using slr. the very basic/naive model of the sample data can be a point, but the error in the predicted and observed value will be significant in most cases. then we move on towards slr, for data, if we can plot a best-fit line then the line can be predicted by simple linear regression as y= b0+b1x. as we increase the sample size, our model will become better as we move toward the population as a sample. similarly, different sample has

649,"we started of with understanding about population vs samples and how the we can use a sample to make 'estimates' about the population. a point to be noted was that a sample should be picked from an appropriate place, that is the location or the center from where we gather our data shouldn't be biased. like the example given during class, it is better to take the sample from a public place than a school, when we are sampling for that area's census. moving on we saw about how and when a clustering or simple linear regression would be better. the key is to minizine the error. we went ahead and talked about the meaning of intercept with the example of sales and how it shows that there is some features we don't know and it gives a bias. in an ideal case we will know all the features and then the line will pass through the (0,0) point in the graph. we also discussed a bit about how to define the error and what could be beneficial and what wouldn't.",-0.01513929,0.03745244,-0.033603884,0.028161343,0.09755491,0.05751029,-0.03337822,0.07533466,-0.010073214,0.066325575,0.029637346,0.02255108,0.010458519,-0.04085512,0.01010759,-0.025432859,0.0528401,-0.020531574,0.02821947,-0.012635463,-0.0038059258,-0.05397846,0.04539768,0.028679414,-0.03578037,-0.028301595,0.029682342,0.0038416062,0.008755588,-0.02007019,-0.0022123195,0.08186277,0.10919944,-0.014878373,-0.019888202,-0.035976306,0.06758426,0.083790824,-0.0019079654,0.053660806,0.021209883,0.030966919,-0.018696463,0.041888155,0.015996175,-0.054426387,0.030770766,0.029383674,-0.008324132,0.070139766,0.022888474,0.035783157,-0.028127767,-0.024115296,-0.036099263,-0.0034598012,-0.059230395,-0.0018673547,0.027537823,0.036520056,0.008187122,-0.074823596,-0.037836812,-0.004299652,-0.008640882,-0.004773213,-0.009150263,0.057233185,-0.020050988,-0.0058900584,-0.039273284,0.009014197,-0.10256584,0.045409016,0.0287878,-0.06014046,0.024815418,-0.005456561,0.052185636,0.008268473,0.010063418,-0.048066054,-0.03766319,-0.014608125,0.02656666,0.019722436,-0.020711215,-0.05496548,0.025982797,-0.03143661,-0.0027702001,0.06165275,-0.0146309035,0.038305625,0.03143586,0.04102589,-0.00038110593,-0.02174115,0.11724109,0.063489266,-0.0045663277,0.05321626,0.011132891,0.02370924,-0.038691357,-0.06477333,0.007279568,-0.010873493,0.013231494,-0.02764535,-0.033981316,0.026439114,-0.058199532,0.06844749,0.08872822,-0.10758819,0.095609635,-0.02639446,-0.07031165,-0.018715417,-0.007336731,0.018032445,-0.0017643004,0.07213449,0.022242505,0.042834427,-0.04286433,-5.194862e-34,-0.03160184,-0.010748452,-0.036243215,0.017930983,-0.03297209,-0.04021661,-0.089030296,0.017054386,0.07729683,0.08863209,0.008979388,-0.08407987,0.09574719,0.05218541,0.17105316,0.053185347,-0.052481096,0.029072808,-0.056844577,0.05339349,-0.07188937,-0.04932111,0.053757124,-0.006409604,-0.028671965,0.084475294,-0.052359387,0.05495946,0.054815426,-0.0150446575,0.037818786,-0.011711341,0.05297948,-0.010190506,-0.040780704,0.018881092,0.041060884,-0.044414166,-0.044438485,-0.00872087,-0.051519495,0.05774902,0.14011428,-0.0048067416,0.09193322,0.054033276,0.027680498,-0.013300883,0.04946334,0.11434585,-0.060807742,-0.021691777,0.0032667804,0.03178621,-0.03638709,0.099690504,-0.06347476,-0.09094532,-0.04952009,0.020103814,-0.050275844,-0.028469078,0.03435685,-0.029557133,0.0061805192,0.09485375,-0.032885626,-0.0010770247,0.037407223,-0.040926937,-0.011620476,0.0069557545,-0.15070078,0.043668233,0.022288421,-0.016107704,0.039576802,0.09756265,0.05642491,-0.024722056,0.045298994,-0.08362311,-0.0849734,-0.07911895,-0.023873778,0.03528242,0.110643096,-0.0581096,0.103921,0.026268078,-0.051618665,0.026245056,-0.11603348,0.080003135,-0.0022378508,-1.8313456e-33,-0.012879405,0.048095338,-0.0065781507,0.008217773,-0.07787723,-0.0017284129,0.0071118944,-0.108379915,0.06318754,-0.021694925,-0.14587897,0.0065332456,0.03185977,0.03030488,-0.012732561,-0.019547973,0.0046193693,-0.08683263,-0.02343315,-0.058634106,0.019649437,0.025566617,-0.012456521,-0.07338242,-0.029313128,0.03518784,-0.14821129,0.007635806,0.0046340865,-0.06973627,-0.022557542,-0.03430562,0.020392086,-0.04732724,-0.0009701642,0.10000292,0.037809636,0.03923791,0.006097967,-0.056778967,0.004653523,0.01937042,-0.03859474,-0.074013874,-0.023655774,0.028289642,-0.0020352798,0.07530068,-0.06274211,0.02132185,-0.018912328,0.10401497,-0.020366164,0.030032055,-0.03873509,-0.0013531828,0.053917184,0.014409705,0.004271719,0.06896305,-0.04477468,0.013209407,-0.1262203,0.07450876,-0.038427677,-0.05606206,0.017587902,-0.06607129,0.03506609,-0.010342849,-0.026078166,-0.05143938,-0.030298464,-0.04640431,-0.10639605,0.011016907,-0.03204704,-0.013368678,-0.03375609,0.017607803,-0.008364722,-0.03615769,0.04928803,-0.009167386,-0.024599364,-0.038640067,-0.0026081642,-0.03763061,-0.010569684,-0.043794,-0.0727026,-0.026407182,-0.088159226,-0.03025482,-0.0045085778,-6.9218416e-08,-0.105712436,0.04577584,0.062597536,0.01947404,0.033308875,0.002021442,-0.030969646,-0.0457577,-0.04414623,0.03523734,0.012204523,0.06458321,-0.12605233,0.01736734,0.01615318,0.037876796,-0.00399577,0.050362628,-0.035033006,0.075896874,-0.046576943,-0.005599054,-0.092936985,-0.073611364,0.08097912,-0.030728074,0.016554758,0.16153422,-0.00028357198,0.008190161,-0.056310765,0.052819747,0.023650253,0.024400234,0.08581586,-0.027488865,-0.0027806547,-0.005258455,0.021063281,-0.05122546,0.009891367,0.025062362,-0.041156296,-0.013059682,0.046283893,0.001178624,-0.003342336,-0.00049922586,0.034260184,-0.006501673,0.004810489,-0.109713785,-0.036007307,-0.053633325,-0.00989192,-0.034176692,-0.07378861,-0.051723786,0.0071566748,0.048425846,0.02521998,0.102360636,-0.065239064,-0.06801036,0,-29.095175,-12.427067,12
654,"the sample from the population should be a good representation of the whole population. we want to estimate the parameters based on the statistics.

model - a mathematical representation of a real-world problem.  
the most basic model - a point (but not a good enough prediction because it's a very naive model).

simple linear regression -  
y = dependent variable or label, and x = independent variable or feature.  
y = b(0) + b(1)*x (only 1 predictor).  
b(0) --> the bias, net sum of all unaccounted variables on prediction.  
b(0) and b(1) are nothing but the estimates of population parameters.  
as the sample size increases, the prediction error keeps on reducing.  
confidence increases if we increase the interval in the confidence interval (c.i.).

criteria for the best fit line - minimize the sum of squares of errors.  
then, we derived the formula for slr (we have a closed-form solution to calculate b(0) and b(1)).

the mean of the observation lies on the prediction line.  
b(0) and b(1) are just point estimates, and we need to arrive at the interval of b(0) and b(1).",-0.08834283,0.013244783,-0.021971835,0.11454804,0.034480624,0.03020996,-0.027918324,0.10996148,-0.021353485,-0.010586415,0.010726835,-0.021686483,0.040029798,-0.0636673,0.0062929033,0.009370102,0.01454408,-0.031174952,-0.033578936,-0.04847143,0.034210745,-0.052729536,-0.006590322,0.04604216,-0.024042368,-0.045414783,-0.013868005,-0.016384872,-0.030313343,-0.006164055,0.048175704,0.01346541,0.056349307,-0.030849207,-0.0036718252,-0.06779514,-0.05240268,0.071980104,0.03405281,0.04625029,0.04084432,0.009651844,0.00040215524,0.056151267,0.056096934,0.00967559,0.025563229,0.02617702,-0.07042734,0.047369376,-0.049597707,0.03340709,0.003547281,-0.030729152,-0.012543668,-0.13371035,-0.07877591,-0.08505747,0.031534273,-0.0025923483,-0.045236934,0.0028876052,0.018241525,-0.044309814,-0.00013189447,0.05502573,0.04832137,-0.009448847,0.026355514,0.038356807,-0.06327442,0.04782357,-0.09460397,0.06821276,-0.02532626,-0.06437925,0.029930994,0.08679424,0.016353015,0.06407835,0.064776905,0.056119386,0.020657469,0.02608601,0.00016914771,0.017769037,0.067533284,-0.04724626,-0.008206355,-0.023726553,0.037034597,0.014820254,-0.06761093,0.05175561,-0.024835996,0.05056194,-0.07545752,-0.056436032,0.022861253,0.05178544,-0.04984819,0.08003227,0.11590297,-0.021515185,0.0013098695,-0.058251325,-0.0029985455,-0.02103617,-0.023511678,0.04613403,0.019718092,0.029103836,-0.04831016,0.06741641,0.12396017,-0.06584976,0.04526286,0.006193685,-0.108449586,0.072839655,0.05004631,0.027769938,0.0017518874,0.04098074,0.010951139,0.10406731,-0.0797938,5.303774e-33,-0.096697435,0.009708739,0.03664519,0.06749279,-0.042056408,-0.01976746,-0.005686252,0.06712984,0.024199393,0.013283423,-0.012193718,-0.13969241,0.028631307,0.052513797,0.08476305,0.07488855,0.012397083,0.04595651,-0.0619816,0.008547168,-0.020146752,-0.07119427,0.029010946,-0.028904293,-0.016508166,-0.015630249,0.04809344,0.07881961,-0.05502067,-0.05019185,0.040834174,-0.058378477,0.0066029504,-0.030971821,0.015256849,-0.051526453,-0.009207603,-0.020924056,-0.011415887,0.06858482,0.004518967,0.078891225,0.09916491,0.048257302,0.042527225,-0.017208433,-0.028283808,-0.008101877,-0.07341588,0.078959264,-0.0611587,-0.014685447,-0.09655869,0.06488818,-0.025630852,0.099779524,-0.066866964,-0.037316475,-0.04341849,-0.02333372,-0.02791636,-0.07254546,0.018232,-0.04456471,0.09207123,0.07000366,0.0006538036,-0.039882034,-0.00867058,-0.022696057,0.058235884,-0.09070171,-0.05011836,0.05360364,-0.046168156,-0.03461405,0.0010492575,-0.0020507022,0.037269406,0.0088757975,0.011741555,0.027017467,-0.0788378,-0.045167647,0.010332693,-0.05931973,0.044289548,-0.019417983,0.0094407415,-0.05431446,-0.05219498,0.027582694,-0.09415548,0.022405576,-0.093221046,-3.8609424e-33,0.028185807,0.0007326193,0.038449597,0.01385395,-0.062637165,-0.004574263,0.027000682,-0.020429332,0.017844625,-0.04760811,-0.055908397,-0.002893696,0.13857533,0.08136144,0.017163761,0.044444833,0.030693935,-0.06864364,0.019483045,0.015919207,-0.030451281,0.009862327,-0.009953245,-0.03114801,-0.06547002,0.0005701431,-0.015956324,0.11748542,0.01319228,-0.10574262,-0.041134942,-0.055538632,-0.020819431,-0.060015436,-0.018920869,0.050619405,0.022260498,0.097260036,-7.6308934e-05,0.059180103,-0.021067705,0.010374095,-0.021449544,-0.11058082,0.028078558,0.05631106,0.051012177,0.0012460183,0.01155601,-0.0007129277,0.006905935,0.053278312,-0.03658615,0.0858379,-0.03224139,-0.05381946,-0.06106903,-0.045254584,-0.032395884,0.0044385237,-0.03728009,0.015226499,-0.092200354,0.04710098,-0.038943797,-0.0076859393,0.0010102309,-0.014796883,0.044840522,-0.024707705,-0.037012815,0.03158138,0.06986385,-0.004214457,-0.07361493,-0.06607199,-0.038960982,-0.0023604513,0.055407282,-0.030853208,-0.04410081,-0.011668558,0.030650945,-0.0585044,-0.035642132,-0.028525203,0.07339019,0.024996921,-0.024467306,0.005138126,-0.06386705,0.027665507,-0.020349218,-0.004613635,-0.0016047696,-7.72941e-08,-0.055937458,0.11168793,0.06104478,0.038771447,0.04473157,-0.012598399,0.01550931,-0.044678114,-0.027726047,0.030649845,0.016900387,0.035337456,-0.017617378,0.033792995,0.024087336,0.112676375,0.042597637,0.060484715,0.013069553,-0.012418533,0.015137227,-0.041028865,-0.02306613,-0.00784486,0.15292522,-0.073594406,0.037676893,0.066306956,-0.027096948,0.037066784,0.010198121,-0.0091968905,0.085416496,0.029360319,0.13838607,-0.041534394,-0.05845746,-0.0459808,0.13699213,-0.01652648,-0.004671666,0.10192578,-0.0605355,-0.013304079,0.11386904,-0.040001918,0.028640043,-0.046954896,-0.016357483,0.010583054,0.10270333,-0.05584247,-0.029953718,0.0609546,0.014036251,0.03693891,-0.036133148,0.03618462,-0.0279821,0.051313117,-0.0041047726,0.054536518,-0.10281341,-0.029951826,0,-27.91541,-7.6769595,12
664,"in this lecture we have learnt about what is population and what is sample. majorly the data we will be working on would be sample that is some part of a population since it's very difficult to collect entire set of data for a certain population. r aim is to estimate the different parameters of a population based on the statics that we obtain from sample of that population. there are multiple attributes which are associated with the data for example, if we have data of marbles in a box we can calculate the frequency of a particular colour of marble, mean, median, mode, standard deviations etc. of the data and can also perform various operations on it such as addition, subtraction etc.
there are different types of models like line, point which can be used depending on the type of data we have. point is considered a naive model. then studied the example of simple linear regression with one predictor which was advertisement expenditure, for which equation would be y = b_0 + b_1x in which b_0 and b_1 of the sample are the point estimates. therefore we can say that b_0 and b_1 will be the same values for the population with 0% confidence. find out the confidence interval in which we have good enough confidence to claim that these are only the values for the population. the b_0 is known as bias which accounts for other factors that might affect sales. so if we increase the number of predictive variables then bias will decrease and if we include all the predictive variables then bias would be zero.
then we studied how to find out b_0 and b_1 for the sample. we must try to minimise the sum of squares of errors where error is the distance between actual value and the predicted value. lastly we got the conclusion from the model that the mean of predictor values and response values lie on the best fit
