16,"today, we built on our understanding of statistical significance before shifting gears to python, where we were assigned tutorials to prepare for the next class.  

we also looked at how data science algorithms analyze session summaries using a relative strength approach. this method calculates the distance between different submissions based on scatter plot coefficients, helping to evaluate patterns effectively.  

later, we dove into **multiple linear regression**, where a dependent variable is influenced by multiple independent factors. a key concept we explored was the **f-value**, which helps gauge a modelâ€™s effectiveness by comparing explained and unexplained varianceâ€”a higher f-value suggests a better fit. using a dataset, we applied error metrics and compared f-values, getting some hands-on

31,"today we discussed statistical significance before moving on to python, where tutorials were assigned to prepare for our next class.

in this session, we learned how data science algorithms judge session summaries with a relative strength method where distances between submissions were calculated using scatter plot coefficients.

later, we studied multiple linear regression, where the dependent variable is influenced by more than one independent variable. we learned about f-value, which measures model effectiveness by measuring explained versus unexplained varianceâ€”a higher f-value indicative of a better model. using a dataset, we calculated error metrics and compared f-values to practically assess model performance.",0.015968874,-0.03630125,-0.023730475,0.035656273,0.095090985,-0.050220754,-0.057359222,0.08491843,0.0071421964,-0.0012784797,-0.07185753,0.048310414,0.022771643,0.053815477,0.016278248,-0.07729229,0.066161424,-0.043592308,-0.10825064,-0.050557744,-0.021749858,0.007184422,0.043734215,0.06042366,0.091070585,-0.027958173,-0.08287446,0.037615318,-0.025905225,-0.004682556,-0.041136947,0.041649237,0.005117468,0.030828267,-0.009044866,0.007372705,0.05327434,0.04399748,0.052320395,0.000382171,-0.11597631,-0.03680815,0.08190308,-0.03394909,0.0153859705,-0.07814409,-0.060322892,-0.028295124,-0.020476466,0.036273744,-0.07115963,-0.00959282,-0.04572228,-0.022766689,-0.002059661,0.0017630083,0.054893166,-0.03202962,-0.0021455598,-0.01357715,-0.02935331,-0.04394329,-0.03598207,0.045555,0.056757923,0.012443714,-0.050012305,0.007939592,0.013256713,0.07135331,-0.08851666,0.060685944,-0.057390098,0.049358882,0.08788575,-0.008405664,-0.002928427,-0.01808415,0.0045412076,-0.039070003,-0.019530648,-0.028752422,-0.02342519,0.045078803,0.046827417,-0.069289155,0.085449405,0.010954367,-0.02672198,-0.009452362,0.058507875,0.024268579,-0.005055492,0.04797382,-0.07446054,0.07274503,-0.010529978,-0.073308006,0.00821832,0.059381668,0.030192265,0.051744185,-0.0020948425,-0.051730122,0.07131976,-0.038689155,0.055694185,-0.09893526,0.030893508,-0.059422027,-0.010877025,-0.005198294,-0.089040995,0.077625714,0.050415974,-0.04081234,-0.032437082,0.05141228,-0.049732957,0.00803115,0.05542124,-0.010608644,0.064849734,0.003018825,0.0014263837,-0.04175378,-0.13086288,5.9730604e-33,0.00385412,0.020217676,0.0006208296,0.12433794,0.05507431,-0.058445092,-0.048278015,0.01677474,-0.006027814,0.02429906,-0.052568536,0.09951693,0.022950266,-0.0028271044,0.06255832,0.066375434,-0.076381795,0.0468425,-0.07162171,0.04827649,0.08035557,-0.06539795,0.05460034,-0.031423286,0.08315284,0.03060821,-0.043610573,0.029088786,-0.12224016,0.026782164,-0.02898879,-0.019074257,0.001414974,0.011744449,0.0009042419,-0.033205114,-0.04222666,-0.0939876,0.08101821,0.039766,-0.07544439,0.026603898,-0.016884957,-0.048258908,-0.015678395,0.07104751,-0.062158663,-0.013470839,0.008885444,0.02133131,-0.036409713,-0.0059496756,0.03806416,0.022733994,-0.0776083,0.044189937,-0.0070436858,-0.060248386,-0.049533945,-0.021027226,-0.004240099,0.026814003,-0.029454935,-0.09907171,-0.04014401,0.044180453,0.001961093,0.10502208,0.06414198,0.003963665,-0.06753372,0.030654466,-0.07095168,-0.080752,0.040548462,-0.023232948,0.050279163,-0.071716875,0.018718868,-0.030059608,0.012658419,-0.023813978,-0.040200386,-0.064180456,-0.06250432,0.005755145,0.025621863,-0.019106317,-0.040597234,-0.022012504,0.021724802,0.01203464,-0.058457464,-0.037308402,-0.028528016,-6.833453e-33,-0.06748565,0.058600716,0.0076117995,0.09539402,0.006266508,-0.025559135,0.028220387,-0.05067337,0.03917297,-0.0075831865,-0.040547144,-0.0025426033,0.016122267,-0.010682383,0.041610703,0.0029636396,-0.023280846,-0.055254508,-0.014180603,0.001624774,0.042646542,0.06926256,0.008491929,-0.076783575,-0.05516313,-0.020041136,-0.018933,-0.07552967,-0.0688377,-0.10331887,0.026304843,0.01358355,-0.009084929,0.011636329,0.04601211,0.06548318,0.043381028,-0.084143795,0.020906,0.07891794,0.07177652,0.07435258,-0.03528609,-0.007845446,-0.007828305,0.06010867,-0.010594906,0.053175643,0.08256956,-0.019893002,0.007856671,0.0078069805,-0.027721418,-0.012997865,-0.031971145,-0.07510722,0.012643676,-0.043850012,-0.103232,0.12000498,-0.09100329,0.008587568,-0.011443902,0.073051214,-0.034050867,-0.028932422,-0.07369473,-0.03609455,-0.0040078475,0.049643815,0.02933294,-0.053095948,0.023653854,0.012854795,-0.052180275,0.031856522,-0.021785714,-0.054379098,-0.10429918,0.10511824,-0.020773537,-0.023102984,0.01671999,-0.035283085,-0.06928794,0.0922478,0.04509364,0.091944374,0.028979413,-0.05858588,-0.04260179,0.06077899,-0.020505004,-0.058928747,0.06692329,-5.622503e-08,-0.026933618,0.006104659,0.08860791,0.056556653,-0.019183036,0.057014067,-0.027705472,0.07544677,-0.067503564,0.051267546,0.072750196,-0.018292228,-0.079016924,0.04206264,-0.007257096,0.0671456,0.03344855,0.0644923,-0.059799366,-0.0020260576,0.052470703,-0.0012518148,-0.021348119,0.002094523,0.002975379,-0.048801478,-0.026938936,0.13986954,-0.011064199,0.017371967,0.056122534,-0.009292127,-0.031803142,-0.016811188,0.08067552,0.06771086,-0.020465828,-0.002425061,0.027392518,0.12711258,-0.060227484,0.049659032,-0.050194878,0.105149515,0.10563706,0.07300438,-0.037070982,-0.017928602,-0.026386278,-0.07705649,0.027433356,-0.048421323,-0.08421192,0.025611727,0.032735743,0.06738518,-0.07460486,0.027165886,-0.02095931,-0.040803704,0.03893317,0.036883622,-0.0019619022,-0.02980644,1,-9.108719,7.4435544,1
35,"we talked about predicting things using several factors. this is called multiple linear regression.  we use different inputs (like x1, x2, etc.) to predict an outcome (y).  the basic idea is:

we also use the f-value to see how accurate our prediction is. it compares how much of the variation we explain to how much we don't. a higher f-value usually means a better model which predicts.

we looked at some data and calculated different errors and statistics. we learned that there's no single ""good"" f-value. it's more sensible to compare f-values between different predictionsâ€”the higher one again is the  better one.",0.044654135,-0.03865904,-0.09602903,0.035228495,0.09364451,0.048298072,-0.02489072,0.10086721,0.085964575,0.02587352,-0.031168867,0.0155384615,-0.0020250103,0.091313906,0.03394909,-0.044850085,-0.015709914,0.028310066,-0.10199803,-0.046122707,0.0057023214,-0.09144983,0.033928096,-0.0018669118,-0.010833282,-0.01947744,-0.13454874,0.028613694,-0.098842174,-0.026668437,0.036721043,0.1106575,0.06785239,-0.023934182,-0.10629886,-0.016413767,-0.037286397,0.032640412,0.008768041,0.022112,-0.08261461,-0.02659402,0.094405256,-0.004500851,-0.009375187,0.0036379318,0.016634945,-0.0115736555,0.0056313304,0.10630232,-0.03128679,0.060824912,-0.025284471,0.03670021,0.06255747,0.0035532583,0.01135513,0.003087625,-0.055978604,0.042795908,-0.061858494,-0.0009432004,-0.030715525,-0.0061796415,0.09810536,0.025718521,-0.114007026,-0.12919354,-0.112651564,0.0909961,0.00988363,0.036078345,0.04787951,-0.080984116,0.09859804,-0.023416143,-0.013585197,0.08270205,0.0050504636,0.06562115,0.08666916,0.025434239,-0.040582463,-0.050708678,0.029447947,-0.007922266,0.0051873573,-0.058297306,-0.043304324,0.11396364,0.024366144,0.01080114,-0.016693832,0.066003814,-0.017881775,0.06774011,0.013278894,-0.03035831,0.025234103,0.003758213,-0.048458256,-0.031246826,0.05296327,-2.0547952e-05,0.04535175,-0.05536646,0.01645471,-0.007295119,0.0053323656,-0.07408455,-0.02542918,-0.0028504052,0.014083278,0.009687024,0.020861989,-0.029243665,-0.02603352,-0.00983996,0.028284106,0.006860897,0.014863698,-0.069136694,0.060678974,0.07180082,-0.00054600654,0.01230863,-0.15170997,3.1245672e-33,-0.060943007,0.069406465,0.03068157,0.034702864,-0.020287244,-0.07943034,0.007142571,-0.011002408,0.08459162,0.014717877,-0.014976056,0.056918647,-0.0035849002,0.03131913,0.03539516,-0.053142127,0.012290978,-0.03613536,-0.02259596,0.033925068,0.11476667,-0.051547345,0.06761099,-0.07622959,0.063241206,-0.02700353,0.0078293085,0.0690705,-0.10622785,-0.0223111,-0.054697484,0.027864859,-0.019464256,-0.04383894,0.03154258,-0.073187426,-0.005529245,-0.018093642,-0.056056753,-0.010998757,-0.0066571604,0.0339296,-0.021396779,-0.037827216,0.13642432,0.019472012,-0.099160805,0.019224692,-0.057136975,0.11583905,0.0054157097,-0.0007112248,-0.0037377528,-0.007891818,-0.01861523,0.023826918,-0.04320134,-0.06911318,-0.0736965,0.01710004,-0.075725295,-0.020449445,-0.00044380102,-0.061822604,-0.101451345,0.078564174,0.098205075,0.030812902,0.05478151,0.056154747,0.027658734,0.052860104,-0.0058996896,-0.03796414,0.063961826,0.016103735,-0.0110483505,-0.09367263,0.030699546,-0.08249875,-0.029976211,0.090596475,-0.06732155,0.007945403,-0.06483113,-0.012709041,-0.04715701,0.017277325,0.043072186,-0.032122545,-0.020907579,0.038004275,0.0076315207,0.0001853481,0.054457568,-4.7468357e-33,-0.04596113,0.039794877,0.0074983183,0.06566275,-0.006229097,-0.009698745,0.003639891,-0.08684805,0.060034897,0.02374475,-0.027195029,0.00074467825,0.027409127,-0.05435262,0.007825352,0.021366293,-0.035519626,-0.07228717,-0.016765833,-0.012402616,-0.010076679,0.046741646,0.012348101,0.014829545,-0.07272499,-0.0056085563,-0.07714444,-0.013653156,-0.015744565,-0.045526285,-0.028019447,-0.01444514,0.08964972,-0.048955645,0.013192554,0.0071376287,0.056214508,-0.056944117,-0.026445163,0.016457165,0.045790058,0.08995949,0.056550477,-0.07129031,-0.011754581,0.036895253,-8.4017156e-05,0.018154383,0.12883835,0.03408645,0.01216701,-0.034629744,-0.12009214,-0.037248705,-0.08602615,-0.039448045,-0.029047647,0.011057831,-0.06077606,0.08688054,0.0050773225,-0.020699402,0.0052768774,0.10042114,-0.05415458,-0.028607288,-0.0458937,-0.039053183,0.058416378,0.087365925,-0.016913522,-0.0509984,0.037504632,0.091570854,-0.039705366,-0.057488643,0.024327897,-0.05733168,-0.05174261,0.1367964,0.014763441,0.004385086,-0.028463311,-0.0081701875,-0.10923389,0.007405942,0.0009764632,0.028139254,0.007096022,-0.09584833,-0.010803153,0.025677564,-0.06873237,-0.047396112,0.0045902357,-5.6280438e-08,-0.036368426,-0.036599252,0.02073818,0.0101837,-0.015955877,-0.029948657,-0.025750296,0.012117649,0.029468603,-0.031576086,0.01229215,0.104641855,-0.07179495,0.003245355,0.02228263,-0.022935286,0.060804747,4.2370786e-05,0.031884935,0.0395148,0.008107066,0.02226131,-0.049586218,-0.03907928,0.10662193,-0.051351946,-0.044946432,0.090103574,-0.010456596,0.08263591,0.017244855,0.017353052,0.032771535,-0.038337927,-0.016344806,0.03411784,0.024594512,-0.025578896,-0.0077104396,0.015115473,0.01783993,0.056321,-0.015883015,-0.017402126,-0.005312009,0.020868609,0.06509045,-0.059954204,-0.04985378,-0.053977083,0.037670497,0.034470204,-0.03001905,-0.0021824588,-0.011495441,-0.0034684085,-0.042895544,0.02895258,0.019567762,-0.03543379,0.03087909,-0.056517683,0.07127884,-0.0027301847,5,-9.669348,-0.9622119,1

train vs test (unseen) data split for any ml model.


loss of degree of freedom in r-squared. when one knows the mean (x bar) the number of unkown observations in the sample drops by 1. however, larger the population the smaller the relative change in degree of freedoms. h.w. check if dropping a variable in x vector brings up adjusted r-squared. 

linear regression need not output a line as the relatipn between y and x vector. 

sklearn or scikitlearn has many builtin functions including linearregression class. a quantile plot was presented in class.

the notion of better models comes from comes from a few metrics. aic & bic are two such metrics - lower the better.

55,"today we initiated our class with process of working on data, how ml model should be done, it is not supposed to used the entire sample to creation of ml models. we are supposed to divide the sample into trained data and test (unseen) data. the split is done randomly with a usual training to test ratio being 4:1. there are other commonly used ratio but, the decesion on which ratio to choose depended on the number of observations, that is size of the sample.
so how do we compare the outcomes the model gives us. two outcomes training metrics are like f value, r^2, confidence, and etc. the test metrics r^2 but it doesn't have  confidence interval, as we don't make statistics here. 
we also looked about overfitting and followed with data drift which is basically minute changes in data after a some interval if time.
lastly we were again given a heads up for the usage of python from the following classes and we were also shown and talked about some packages and libraries of python.",-0.07009527,-0.041105486,-0.03567813,0.046285573,-0.0007245753,-0.09781346,-0.112946115,0.056243107,0.023226535,-0.083887786,-0.018590229,0.0149187045,-0.0044266935,-0.008057721,0.0114074955,-0.114255875,0.08578727,0.0040887813,-0.0862216,-0.051251862,0.0055126147,-0.015026693,0.02977655,0.09872714,-0.025013875,-0.11634624,0.050738033,0.021924065,-0.032128975,0.0032583359,0.06340571,-0.031711686,-0.026073398,0.025313662,-0.053147294,-0.037674505,0.08006234,-0.075968,0.03682277,-0.006640964,-0.0014060278,-0.04668212,0.035920423,0.022641722,-0.04152554,0.046099134,-0.02612211,-0.007716055,-0.001686928,0.016928334,-0.106284976,0.052314326,-0.07025864,-0.02993448,-0.06588517,0.0025475163,0.010119476,-0.06505001,-0.054800913,-0.06385525,-0.060114086,-0.061448656,-0.03623446,0.009235547,-0.11012047,-0.052906867,-0.013860698,0.03819323,0.13438421,-0.03832202,-0.07339676,0.06558855,-0.042826552,0.066565104,0.008447067,0.012012005,0.061299868,-0.0070367684,-0.02668271,-0.0021262092,-0.014585626,0.020836296,0.032254595,0.047658753,-0.021407217,-0.04412811,0.110211834,0.121655814,0.0005444457,-0.107541576,0.092933856,0.06434334,-0.051957093,-0.015368071,0.015728258,0.12291729,0.011754333,-0.06042129,0.08507618,0.04599251,-0.009416761,-0.022478117,0.0013131959,-0.083107725,0.07419405,0.019193787,0.010261738,-0.065939456,0.109874584,-0.01729035,0.09409292,-0.013428469,-0.04415353,0.068753265,0.11947282,-0.01847703,-0.120106265,0.016320225,-0.072827086,0.09662096,-0.0056161718,0.054495625,0.069267265,-0.055389546,0.026031427,0.05710218,-0.051676318,4.0943038e-33,-0.028801285,-0.04888353,0.07357363,0.060094904,0.009617428,-0.003663711,-0.020116761,0.052237622,0.07535999,0.018548762,-0.030430362,0.026861314,-0.016640507,-0.022949204,0.055457998,0.01686643,-0.069659114,0.01738815,0.004702873,0.074557245,0.051490244,-0.026926441,0.09421811,0.0317561,0.044720374,-0.025954742,-0.051738843,0.060475826,-0.051405266,0.006020635,-0.08209531,-0.024053412,-0.014139822,0.016452199,0.028607571,0.017841047,-0.047187343,0.053798296,-0.030849518,-0.048752323,-0.04551466,-0.015577159,0.0051232977,-0.06354923,-0.06418725,-0.038601607,-0.043788776,-0.015168204,0.038552333,-0.011588038,0.052438416,-0.050902613,0.011848654,-0.03593173,-0.0701539,0.06339234,0.028604593,0.05977111,-0.0073014186,0.02722701,0.018858152,-0.033605106,0.040962443,-0.019921802,0.00058767444,0.018938337,-0.009704312,0.0150993075,0.016530473,0.03244191,-0.022746155,-0.048457425,-0.08129045,0.029769853,0.003165948,-0.01321971,0.07097002,-0.030119805,0.026099091,0.04858481,-0.0013666055,0.027152857,-0.020828154,-0.13867824,-0.046931162,-0.02184425,0.04764126,0.03870055,0.0029472064,-0.067339584,-0.098620184,0.006292845,-0.015223327,0.0003152522,0.03950354,-6.993175e-33,0.0535373,0.04042438,0.014910143,0.11058529,-0.037211467,-0.014924102,0.016139776,0.06392988,0.010596902,-0.0049537546,0.024114767,-0.021376077,0.092552006,0.034753032,-0.02075885,0.0014240954,0.017201504,-0.06708725,0.023367336,0.0057660644,0.048343983,0.048377514,-0.036779366,-0.10425371,-0.10268957,0.002424675,-0.029926665,-0.0058790846,0.027635323,-0.06260708,0.042082567,-0.0016531401,0.025327612,-0.0064664274,0.017976318,-0.02953004,0.07494241,-0.033781048,0.044658177,0.113841474,0.08894609,0.02430834,-0.0670917,0.01502982,-0.031405907,-0.013591938,0.0030990911,-0.0048500584,0.0048211757,-0.096038826,0.032129224,0.0239998,-0.04088087,0.04683183,-0.01656275,-0.070883535,-0.055514116,-0.016171234,-0.050756674,0.078908116,-0.049913067,-0.037982177,-0.09897264,0.123578325,-0.07278853,0.062361866,-0.040667985,0.046132848,0.012060629,0.107787035,0.014591316,0.03908628,0.04690436,-0.045951825,-0.046486236,0.04682894,-0.028108357,-0.00966535,-0.026143504,0.009015377,-0.010245984,-0.11590011,-0.025181493,0.03554245,-0.058227856,0.024804974,0.107737854,0.04117144,0.025028566,-0.023962488,-0.059507545,-0.01774454,-0.0060232547,-0.0004659201,0.017439673,-7.536308e-08,-0.023304647,0.0024851188,0.10219775,0.07519117,-0.05323538,0.067553945,-0.09484752,0.022333857,-0.037311688,0.04741798,-0.02047244,-0.03738628,-0.111989915,-0.010619568,0.01689789,0.05297632,-0.013461742,0.0748648,0.021587664,0.0008958586,0.005458882,-0.039422866,0.043210458,-0.044404864,-0.02320149,0.042584028,-0.038630318,0.04579752,-0.09731286,-0.030469386,-0.022971198,-0.05497812,-0.010494195,-0.042800114,0.04254876,0.03582923,-0.004035123,-0.017835325,0.022874549,0.03691628,-0.039568048,0.0475389,-0.07374475,-0.022110952,0.053936582,-0.014570569,0.04046229,0.0514852,0.002671073,-0.018529143,-0.01332468,0.005723004,-0.026590656,-0.019706616,0.011127329,0.051405277,-0.055538427,0.0051212544,-0.09769615,-0.00783158,0.02656253,0.009171913,0.009442422,-0.0581093,1,-6.2605085,4.4819837,1
60,"in class, we picked up from where we left off, focusing on some key statistical concepts. we talked about terms from the data analysis toolpack, what they mean, how theyâ€™re connected, and how to interpret them visually, including the errors and uncertainties that can come with them.
we went over cases involving beta and beta 0 in specific scenarios, and we talked about the p-value and how it helps with feature selection. we also explored multiple linear regression and discussed

108,"firstly we learned about area under the curve and probability of a specific value . 

then we learned about slr using python using sklearn and ols .
then we learned about mlr and various topics associated with it like division of data between train and test set , mlr using spreasheets and mlr using ols , feature selection in mlr . 

we learned about the interpretation of error in two models : intra and inter model interpretations 

at last we learned about handling non linearity using mlr ",-0.017701248,-0.08617064,0.0043207477,0.0938691,0.059199996,-0.08249431,-0.038859267,0.062015843,-0.039436847,-0.05980573,0.026229223,0.020878466,0.0037716995,0.016561251,-0.006531979,-0.02617957,-0.009192557,0.024590157,-0.0649644,-0.052184824,-0.010832608,-0.02407601,-0.04112728,0.06772101,0.042413168,0.00860848,-0.011376889,0.0712739,-0.01691031,-0.032749485,0.035376478,-0.010846844,0.0053202915,0.01670109,-0.057682067,-0.03349687,0.03043983,0.012533905,0.07581836,0.00802122,-0.0056951395,-0.050462663,0.009375925,-0.023742586,0.103582986,-0.021110853,-0.042600177,-0.1358855,-0.014920044,0.042080615,-0.029269094,-0.033238042,-0.0071024694,0.010845746,-0.0037443799,0.047216307,0.00875556,0.033427,0.03741072,-0.011594039,-0.03754807,-0.051997583,-0.06438121,0.025787838,0.014410824,-0.020846039,0.010146444,0.023217212,-0.021988433,-0.025844116,-0.054679114,0.059692718,-0.084017545,0.0025203244,-0.0040657627,-0.034547094,0.025552915,0.038102493,-0.009041267,0.023065945,-0.040759616,0.054233223,0.003945725,0.016587613,0.06991403,-0.019782426,0.06440358,0.009588379,0.024849162,-0.006918257,0.05938073,-0.023817489,-0.076512925,0.04273789,-0.009852464,0.062462732,0.018202169,-0.07193378,0.005591899,0.03621592,0.011060092,0.011497348,0.034827333,-0.03535993,0.016613927,-0.009461015,0.03680953,-0.00036417638,0.09543827,0.021587998,0.017246611,0.008641365,-0.015045764,0.025448399,0.07526137,-0.05927084,0.030758226,0.015625302,-0.053030524,0.041546747,-0.0416366,-0.009800715,0.092622824,0.029297134,0.054455537,-0.03923241,-0.08793057,3.1455465e-33,-0.03447406,-0.08593251,-0.010270254,0.060327943,-0.022981603,0.021050964,-0.009744828,0.004729495,0.07983158,-0.033752453,0.030489609,0.03298336,0.01424885,0.0037621397,0.1173188,0.049421366,-0.053686503,0.014356193,-0.016583415,0.026249873,0.002386675,-0.058532488,0.033488583,-0.065963775,0.015253804,0.055260982,-0.021293228,-0.022691298,-0.041265294,0.011429648,-0.021442443,0.02975932,-0.0027195367,0.018568221,0.050612565,0.022148065,0.02737497,-0.061784122,-0.028511707,-0.04775702,-0.0010215883,-0.023923853,0.08209215,-0.032656837,0.02059382,0.04924605,0.0638206,-0.038940378,-0.02749203,-0.023261702,-0.096096225,-0.0718118,-0.032601617,-0.02006623,0.050229307,0.111566305,-0.066441976,-0.033875816,-0.03216369,0.006029532,0.01028694,0.045012146,0.037110507,-0.06728438,-0.015038841,0.029259332,-0.025221625,0.03550913,-0.024500271,-0.08280592,-0.09482049,0.0037098895,-0.05891296,0.026619032,-0.012580212,-0.05774452,-0.015812121,-0.017682374,0.09751736,-0.041147377,0.0015090854,-0.061675187,-0.056620188,-0.07762945,-0.072891265,0.05087194,0.018855255,-0.022461988,-0.009362028,-0.008400242,-0.07182136,0.013853651,-0.056739166,0.0106044,0.04253408,-5.2858796e-33,-0.07210485,0.04290173,0.012209388,0.08325353,-0.049397044,-0.009948185,0.016074399,-0.03450602,0.05982436,-0.0026785359,-0.041052036,-0.024007684,-0.031448483,0.038063183,0.060376313,0.0028936989,-0.072288156,-0.03993804,0.037717976,0.06606507,0.053270597,0.0139760105,-0.14308193,0.032293953,-0.04541735,0.02143688,-0.067145616,0.015237447,-0.06932588,-0.03540822,-0.0076130335,0.008779204,0.035712864,-0.06448921,-0.018733744,0.061208062,0.084698305,-0.027537944,0.019123163,-0.0038439056,0.05137757,0.054686178,0.007984932,-0.04304237,-0.034008794,-0.037856355,0.0042006806,0.025382595,0.026717411,-0.028171275,0.030946387,0.0041886508,-0.10570725,0.022614166,-0.053587344,0.04025512,0.019118326,-0.07829953,-0.009258663,0.026673535,-0.04892058,0.01325185,-0.017601082,0.08041501,-0.08668937,-0.018774716,-0.047637623,0.0217691,-0.015026376,-0.032219637,-0.03109616,-0.0005747747,0.05503997,-0.031378727,6.809063e-05,-0.043936227,-0.054750636,-0.0074311066,-0.06902583,0.009165615,0.029470036,-0.049239036,0.018002741,0.056465562,-0.024578195,0.115097865,0.0843934,-0.020385021,-0.020498602,-0.17678939,-0.031839166,0.04941872,-0.006636233,0.017978245,-0.020084413,-4.3699885e-08,-0.10712787,-0.02485907,0.11615613,-0.043557473,0.003414256,0.020514928,-0.053101998,0.098625325,-0.11098713,0.1016358,0.0028867156,0.06503358,-0.13098826,-0.022924338,0.10441325,0.07406765,0.103372104,0.12578493,-0.015861811,-0.0059376946,0.1393223,-0.060013253,0.051530793,-0.043139935,0.12220284,-0.09002349,-0.05165297,0.16244134,-0.010222321,-0.017411822,0.040318266,0.0054176897,0.06231999,0.038568806,0.13992622,0.046182614,0.102456205,-0.11242583,0.010990864,0.062024936,-0.07830269,0.045087773,-0.004983231,-0.018904038,0.054657552,0.060326956,-0.009153003,-0.078415014,-0.021690225,-0.008473502,0.049587063,-0.017781937,-0.023216091,0.088471316,0.0575425,0.011819815,-0.022887502,-0.022665236,-0.10300428,0.046669215,0.018568827,0.04023617,-0.05057294,0.015979363,1,-6.8378634,-11.35844,1
120,"good data
	â€¢	key principles:
	â€¢	machine learning models thrive on high-quality data that is representative of the problem space.
	â€¢	properly prepared data minimizes noise and bias, ensuring better predictions and generalization.
	â€¢	characteristics:
	â€¢	relevant features, sufficient data size, and balanced representation of classes or conditions are critical.
	â€¢	handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring feature scaling or normalization are part of good data preparation.

simple linear regression (slr)
	â€¢	concept: slr models the relationship between two variables (one independent and one dependent) as a straight line, defined by the equation  y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x , where:
	â€¢	 y : dependent variable (response).
	â€¢	 x : independent variable (predictor).
	â€¢	 \beta_0 : intercept.
	â€¢	 \beta_1 : slope (rate of change in  y  with respect to  x ).
	â€¢	point estimates:
	â€¢	coefficients  \beta_0  and  \beta_1  are calculated from the sample data.
	â€¢	they serve as estimates for the true population parameters.
	â€¢	while exact coincidence with the population parameters is unlikely, they offer useful approximations.
	â€¢	derivation of coefficients:
	â€¢	the estimates  \hat{\beta}_0  (intercept) and  \hat{\beta}_1  (slope) are derived using the least squares method, which minimizes the sum of squared residuals (differences between observed and predicted values).

\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}, \quad
\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x}.

large).",0.06040522,0.023380943,-0.010908469,0.021625696,0.0003821706,0.071516395,0.032423783,0.115885556,0.0071558263,0.07175939,0.041439377,0.059723128,-0.055413462,-0.030017946,-0.011487921,-0.014832117,0.025451172,-0.0899569,-0.05865313,0.0076753544,-0.034559924,-0.07950576,0.03566346,0.031040855,-0.019094387,0.031163624,-0.058752663,0.030548979,0.0014258777,0.0055146446,-0.025245303,0.07538709,0.0719793,0.056006607,0.00091754145,0.029749075,-0.03169637,0.058491066,0.0021160252,0.06265974,-0.020888664,-0.09360497,0.046941493,0.010253381,0.039957967,-0.08813908,-0.054018,-0.029632516,-0.05709172,0.0005347613,-0.0575476,-0.009168038,-0.07550778,0.018140629,-0.022593612,-0.07149987,-0.013143614,-0.01159811,0.0045465976,0.040427044,0.04372421,0.008576702,-0.074345425,0.12535338,0.022327172,0.040108506,-0.06161268,-0.053253893,-0.0062388037,0.042413816,-0.04951085,-0.03307198,-0.09749844,0.018705979,0.046909016,-0.08515372,-0.03726535,0.02931496,-0.006950737,-0.033718266,0.07211667,0.027111674,-0.07587596,0.009468189,0.020546423,-0.0057395757,-0.027597146,0.025894878,-0.0820344,0.024397317,-0.0037954843,-0.019130543,-0.05843942,0.07977215,0.025484152,-0.009266242,-0.051720515,-0.10233115,0.063700944,-0.011148511,0.02314323,0.07736027,-0.028403064,0.008826182,-0.065838985,-0.035403896,0.0008756055,-0.09646519,0.048152655,0.02369377,-0.1427806,-0.007911493,-0.0269357,-0.05374352,0.061809253,-0.07884745,-0.037612233,0.05903374,0.059137445,0.013118089,0.06281682,-0.012126163,0.036968745,-0.035422962,0.0026424245,-0.016868683,-0.19486026,-7.137916e-34,-0.024824789,-0.0250874,-0.026129186,0.122583464,-0.006556933,0.026137438,-0.023008088,-0.04420906,-0.0013235944,0.046138857,0.020398831,0.11519328,-0.031682104,0.002322704,0.08918026,0.06890069,0.0019542438,0.06394317,-0.032788444,0.018617898,0.022543227,-0.055078704,0.03273886,0.055409577,0.068032846,-0.015494503,-0.04112809,0.047265057,-0.075219825,-0.0062741856,-0.025678102,0.035264034,-0.021027625,-0.0628367,-0.035402447,-0.03316542,0.049819414,-0.02266493,0.0021317017,-0.023605486,-0.10076274,0.015481401,-0.012195721,-0.02168314,0.08846542,-0.032227993,0.028200215,0.005505343,0.002443396,0.0051063974,-0.05984922,-0.020794025,0.052506596,0.03460059,-0.103427485,0.089992866,-0.098112755,0.008461641,-0.12197249,-0.0032207007,0.02275681,0.09627367,-0.02282738,-0.07967986,-0.020518932,0.08903458,0.005121677,0.045603238,0.06449034,-0.0062802345,-0.032755278,-0.008396088,-0.005843702,0.008717034,0.040027678,-0.01141447,-0.0043743006,-0.01341805,0.018872645,-0.05153779,-0.038129404,-0.076769404,0.04159642,-0.03443396,-0.056062587,-0.0058444142,0.060452383,-0.015323702,0.008682346,-0.044072155,-0.013491738,0.041775554,-0.05515024,-0.0138612455,0.006134068,-5.530425e-33,-0.047197543,0.058804885,-0.09150433,0.023234688,0.05961312,0.0028504936,0.013744551,-0.049537603,0.03728582,-0.029339097,-0.044120174,0.003441062,0.005009378,-0.09194944,-0.028071575,-0.014130826,-0.024625782,-0.05469819,-0.03435181,0.0143371485,0.004428659,0.111435786,-0.0029029716,-0.020531652,-0.081411734,0.02282848,-0.065968245,-0.062868,-0.002929435,-0.056437373,0.03185659,0.02616776,0.0061890823,-0.04159592,-0.021988655,0.019934075,0.07162461,-0.042422168,0.02120176,0.058080904,0.07522361,0.06589539,0.020486943,-0.0590623,0.045493353,0.0247209,0.03389704,-0.0155897625,-0.0054409974,-0.06269586,0.042622957,0.021698177,-0.00046183274,-0.01779678,0.010382876,0.002954274,0.022144904,-0.049887583,-0.08911052,0.036405567,0.048309464,-0.010762803,-0.033310473,0.08729868,-0.04105281,0.000111526606,-0.018499196,-0.06906502,-0.018787893,-0.0034156153,-0.051695175,-0.036043245,-0.017822484,0.016472025,-0.08145243,-0.00420043,-0.08252526,-0.0320681,0.008445176,0.088038534,-0.04960161,-0.02862165,0.0038367105,-0.08800189,-0.043637056,-0.04738129,-0.023080733,0.041664045,0.02931766,-0.06317595,-0.045609858,0.026274264,-0.14705373,-0.05431299,0.007466753,-5.738542e-08,0.07744787,-0.012124959,0.055143446,-0.001414482,0.05625709,-0.011826825,0.010190772,0.07266118,-0.025830096,0.040294092,0.0022876435,0.048465367,-0.064762734,0.047672175,-0.007283004,0.003234483,0.059819635,0.027401054,-0.007812868,0.013027049,0.06558271,0.011821568,-0.08711361,-0.045467842,0.043638077,-0.0397264,-0.085801594,0.052827816,-0.0315717,0.04567158,0.05507383,0.06393117,0.02132623,-0.09707498,0.031422764,0.06650891,0.10715373,-0.025080975,0.032386195,0.058308743,-0.038556173,-0.017488241,-0.015340726,0.07984251,0.009868636,-0.0004644121,-0.05464675,0.040396933,-0.010212851,-0.082904495,0.027811963,0.059949953,-0.13262719,-0.010876174,-0.029772766,0.098960094,0.00036565034,0.07031382,-0.0024106274,-0.16776869,0.09711005,-0.03691159,-0.0075239674,-0.017105442,1,-15.858551,1.2336977,1
173,"in today's class first we learn some basic features in excel like multiplication ,taking average of the whole row and performing some other functions also . we created terms such as x bar, y bar and some more terms and then we created a scatter plot using excel only. then we used a data analysis tool in excel and created a summary output of a linear regression model which showed different types of values. we then learn about sst, ssr and sse. we also learned about histogram and how to know the nature of distribution from this. then we learnt about gaussian normal distribution which is observed when output is dependent on a large number of unknown causes which are random. for slr, the coefficient of determination is exactly like same as the square of the correlation coefficient between x and y. the more near this coefficient is to 1 the better are the results .we then learned about positive correlation and negative correlation as well. we also learnt that if we take a large amount of samples each of same size and using each of that sample we calculate the mean so if the samples are good then the mean will like close to each other and if we collect all such means and create a frequency distribution or histogram the shape will be of gaussian normal

244,"we resumed (mainly examining various statistical conditions) from where we left off in the previous class, discussing the terms emerging from our extension (data analysis toolpack), and then explored their interconnections and terminologies, what these values signify, their graphical representation, and conclusions associated with certain errors or uncertainties that accompany them.
we examined several instances of beta and beta 0, along with their varying specific case conditions.
we also examined multiple linear regression and noted that several of the terms in our table were primarily significant for this type of regression. we also examined the meaning of the term anova and the related concepts it encompasses (f statistic and the reason for its significance, to be continued in the next session).

246,"class notes summary:

time-series data analysis:

use time-series analysis when data is insufficient for long-range predictions.

small samples may follow a uniform distribution rather than a gaussian distribution.


outcome distribution:

with many unknown variables, the outcome distribution typically approaches a gaussian/normal distribution.


regression analysis:

error decomposition:


sst: total sum of squares

sse: error sum of squares

ssr: regression sum of squares


coefficient of determination ():



correlation:

correlation coefficient (r):

high : strong linear relationship.

low : weak linear relationship.


examples: positive and negative correlation scenarios.


visualization notes:

use histograms for small samples.

248,"we started from the formulae of a and b which we had derived in the previous class. then using excel or any spreadsheet, we found out the values of a and b manually, then showed our result (y cap), errors, y using scatter plots, lines, histograms and other representations. we also looked at the errors arising in our y cap predictions. then using the extensions and data analysis paks (toolkits) we learnt how these tasks can be performed directly without manual effort, saving time. we then looked at some terminologies appearing in the table provided by our extension tool and learnt

250,"if sample space is limited we use time series analysis.all samples don't follow gaussian distribution some follow uniform distribution if size is small.for a large sample variables tend to follow gaussian distribution, then sir discussed regression analysis and then broke down the error as sst=ssr+sse and introduced r-squared value(râ²)= 1-sse/sst, also introduced correlation coefficient(r) and if it's high that means both variables are more closely related and vice-versa, and if -ve r value indicates that both variables are negatively dependent on each other.",-0.015777221,-0.05810067,-0.0003763901,0.029863784,0.056341894,0.015718507,-0.05846439,0.03341914,0.04957047,0.00025979095,0.05769402,0.08330208,-0.0014998554,0.09283526,0.04757002,-0.16681756,0.049258485,-0.045540627,0.0025119272,-0.07098956,0.055799603,-0.054582834,-0.109956466,-0.0015579524,-0.03663087,0.026837414,0.057159204,-0.05208493,-0.0816548,0.019170092,0.029149793,-0.017509269,-0.037352685,0.014180582,-0.057225622,0.020684155,-0.028828308,0.054625344,0.043214124,-0.014263269,-0.022736996,0.04431899,0.0023580668,0.02500834,-0.024366679,0.024826523,0.04990712,-0.07034283,-0.081401035,0.08223907,-0.04133058,0.12247466,0.02530495,0.011281383,0.06297486,-0.034145772,-0.0057767266,0.019555964,0.033134624,0.06741112,0.045362186,0.02099343,-0.035088953,-0.0031602182,0.022871079,0.022312058,-0.048230384,0.1199368,-0.0339404,0.059035562,-0.09296915,0.06796104,-0.16623469,0.08701084,-0.076899186,0.06163143,-0.016526533,-0.0033484425,0.005899556,-0.08351535,0.023811745,0.062944576,0.0010156292,0.001144057,0.03439281,0.032172143,0.019468253,0.11321278,-0.10694923,-0.022275867,0.13140155,0.05379336,0.023106059,-0.00497936,0.02769448,0.0016675118,-0.056269463,-0.0510101,0.08513382,-0.0026407673,0.014154783,0.011735938,0.06769961,0.062932365,0.02060756,-0.06459886,0.0742668,-0.09748409,0.015766064,-0.012593788,-0.026211962,0.022360558,-0.042801335,-0.0026997435,0.068099506,-0.051106773,-0.087139316,0.023773132,-0.09476998,0.027683262,-0.007940419,-0.03463222,-0.04599427,-0.012273975,0.049896456,0.103734404,-0.019303612,1.2518767e-32,0.0024965385,-0.023522591,-0.03401903,0.06346307,-0.010573184,0.09220804,-0.019391088,0.03872406,0.095231265,0.061903954,0.047515206,0.04239695,-0.0030253835,-0.02712887,-0.014950988,0.12984121,-0.03487339,0.05846143,0.02092461,0.025711155,-0.007095864,-0.08022828,0.03702984,0.061010152,0.043334555,-0.09196041,-0.008314046,-0.012088308,-0.09068619,-0.038930714,-0.009955711,0.04987054,-0.044555068,-0.008307053,0.076086394,-0.035508595,0.026259612,0.009161882,-0.04853178,-0.015208435,0.014687162,0.026989961,0.05652837,0.06692035,0.05397229,0.023602005,0.082614705,-0.095738016,0.056135364,0.012599143,-0.03733208,-0.0012624679,-0.043744374,-0.033690915,-0.042089846,0.10762943,-0.03263056,-0.0360145,-0.022604903,0.021743,-0.018404828,-0.0520319,-0.0038319083,-0.086822025,0.11832279,0.05726128,-0.012703403,-0.015112291,0.016560467,0.06834775,0.085965,-0.054852817,-0.039388612,-0.01570549,-0.016856486,-0.06703493,0.051291335,0.02870651,0.012176519,-0.055172432,-0.113314375,-0.094640076,0.035840556,-0.070700794,-0.08601893,-0.06749292,0.017060746,0.06325096,-0.039552703,-0.012490262,-0.038938697,0.04793973,-0.0050204606,0.05432135,-0.048786856,-1.0632482e-32,-0.039650153,0.010426926,0.06868166,0.029351754,0.0067590554,0.01842395,-0.047644556,-0.030372364,0.03574116,0.032304514,-0.03069358,-0.0453473,0.108894736,0.05030843,-0.032572296,0.033423085,0.08845905,-0.06358547,0.040704004,-0.03539432,0.0020029102,-0.012787606,0.08786372,-0.09414381,0.010050431,0.039713014,-0.05722801,0.008292635,-0.078047365,0.003679034,-0.0588514,0.024629587,-0.018935734,0.014858667,-0.038947944,0.03585164,-0.013071433,0.030322671,-0.021103095,-0.021071404,0.049144797,0.08135191,0.05277282,-0.0549626,-0.026623355,-0.0032958202,-0.043287892,0.06418026,0.038924653,0.017315587,-0.00832469,0.031602602,-0.0256989,0.021315351,-0.012800304,0.038759757,-0.008876266,-0.02735916,-0.06783263,0.053015955,0.048672944,-0.05080915,-0.021811586,-0.011230566,-0.090355836,0.052128956,-0.0005172468,-0.014239109,0.100053675,0.016667387,-0.0052939067,-0.005832752,0.03845323,-0.010020923,-0.07980514,-0.02374651,-0.004688556,-0.01598909,0.012553429,0.047876555,0.035585918,0.084832914,-0.028815642,-0.011865285,-0.11991645,0.109785475,-0.035368767,-0.05004982,-0.016611643,-0.026185054,-0.053232674,-0.0010423312,-0.030199641,-0.028965976,0.053017125,-6.3594605e-08,-0.024439683,-0.052919157,0.13993497,-0.042208944,0.0180731,-0.058350023,0.01755403,0.012975069,0.024226844,0.025873726,-0.002203481,-0.012529018,-0.07666565,-0.037277665,0.02690824,-0.027005592,-0.037207995,-0.021787215,-0.0487871,0.0280081,-0.01930098,0.014465556,-0.008145059,0.01336423,0.01526203,0.022062043,0.03010677,-0.015838515,0.022595813,0.020467447,0.030472994,-0.012299007,-0.012182059,-0.06492031,0.10139995,-0.023013502,-0.025740046,0.03601794,-0.022260556,-0.013122821,-0.07947121,0.06795366,-0.015225389,0.02915061,-0.0075444975,-0.03469853,0.045944776,-0.0005185479,0.051848106,-0.0678549,0.029978272,-0.07409217,-0.007899651,0.0045918254,-0.047797494,0.08746587,-0.037263855,0.03521419,-0.06482983,-0.042854767,0.0010243354,0.015113166,-0.039274294,-0.06331215,10,-19.697407,16.80039,1

359,"basics of linear regression - outcome might not be linear, it is simply a linear combination of independent variables y = î²0 + î²1x1 + î²2x2... (powers of independent variables are 1). a taylor series and polynomial regression. independence of (x1)^0,x1, (x1)â²,(x1)â³... ie. powers of (x1). this independence can be proven by computing the wronskian of all the powers of x1 - w(1, x1, (x1) â²...) which is a determinant with its rows consisting of derivatives of functions w.r.t. some independent variable. if this determinant is non zero then the functions are independent and this determinant comes out to be non zero. if the trend of the data is close to a particular xi then the coefficient of that xi would have the most weight in the linear combination of (xj)''s. different models that can be fit - parametric and non parametric. parametric models are flexible and allow for delta analysis directly ie. observing how the label changes upon changing a particular feature. non parametric models examples - random forest, xg boost, k nearest neighbors etc. neural networks (parametric model) introduction. logistic regression (outcome is a classifier). finding eqn for boundaries in logistic regression. sigmoid function of variable (a) = 1/(1+exp(-a)) which can be thought of as an on or off functions (cut off and step up functions).

362,"we first explored some algorithms used for checking assignments, which work by measuring the similarity between answers. this gave us insight into how automated grading systems function. next, we dived into multiple linear regression, where a dependent variable is influenced by multiple independent variables, also known as features. these features are represented as a vector (x1 x2. xn), and the model follows the equation: y=b0+b1x1+b2x2+.+bnxn. alongside the ubiquitous r-values and p-values, we also discussed the f-value, which provides an estimate for assessing the goodness of fit of the model. by definition, an f-value is the ratio of explained to unexplained variation, so the greater the f-value, the better the model.

to test this, we worked with a dataset, calculated error metrics, and analyzed different parameters. one key takeaway was that the f-value, unlike r-values, does not have a fixed reference point as to what counts as ""good."" instead, it is better to compare the f-values of two models and say that whatever model has a higher f-value is generally a better model.",-0.028659662,-0.022157911,-0.07370842,-0.0029331886,0.06768352,0.037900772,0.00175,0.051752206,0.031864706,-0.0117933145,-0.01620677,-0.02321265,0.019243509,0.14140002,-0.005659418,-0.05554105,0.013093623,0.03415145,-0.110331595,-0.05037062,-0.0043391776,-0.0226856,0.032186083,0.049508348,0.0003748273,0.011310071,-0.08032814,-0.009859869,-0.106981605,-0.03905994,0.0037722746,0.09883642,0.03931259,0.02466104,-0.042617965,-0.008789983,-0.013069109,0.043778334,0.017869284,-0.043206118,-0.12076711,-0.055957023,0.09105919,0.0048275264,0.037407372,-0.04605193,-0.053825803,-0.01587778,-0.036255427,0.0652115,-0.020381117,0.03656476,-0.07748422,0.015060298,0.030947095,0.033354398,0.041389797,-0.011130474,-0.019757712,0.025341349,-0.06240517,-0.06451048,-0.004873641,0.05245131,0.05886689,-0.0036780795,-0.108749814,-0.05894114,-0.076672465,0.087502554,-0.09547371,0.08638702,0.023449162,0.013599383,0.014705135,0.053751655,0.020177305,0.041037958,-0.013672361,0.027334502,-0.011462417,0.010816373,-0.0007423537,-0.021287618,0.08771887,-0.058189675,0.05447261,-0.06314476,-0.0074456385,0.073997065,0.03790664,0.010440486,-0.0038962008,-0.0042457674,0.061812468,0.01828468,-0.02385747,-0.074881636,0.0126121165,0.04728725,-0.03829116,0.07487987,0.022645116,-0.075346366,0.06997582,0.005065061,0.029217964,-0.071405694,0.056771886,-0.14787757,-0.04612973,0.03512576,0.010240058,0.028145852,0.054061946,-0.052340906,0.049005866,0.03646752,-0.0054018325,-0.0069134873,0.02069301,-0.03942679,0.08847724,0.042451937,0.03733468,0.007574335,-0.07982586,4.4251143e-33,-0.01320765,0.039753933,-0.0030934475,0.029446421,-0.01671556,-0.12849134,-0.041188896,0.060259484,0.036755808,0.03504961,-0.03989824,0.084747136,-0.0060537998,0.017367147,0.069211625,0.088497125,-0.08151139,0.0012820276,-0.06208105,0.08755665,0.06739175,-0.10656033,0.05392715,-0.049640115,0.022214677,-0.06695626,-0.023507403,0.007943403,-0.06238043,-0.027329115,-0.021688396,-0.019742755,0.0141923195,0.011379024,-0.007889621,-0.031443514,0.0010691157,0.0028878455,-0.0018245572,-0.0022021427,0.041251156,-0.028952764,-0.018428927,0.024529291,0.027173208,0.05152506,-0.051717076,-0.02190284,-0.010868473,0.00768197,0.017696269,-0.0036313587,-0.008851426,0.035371482,-0.09045677,0.020519124,-0.015212617,-0.029435996,-0.06112959,0.03510581,0.04072027,0.04006995,0.0004110718,-0.1042642,-0.050029505,0.018169157,0.034462627,0.061993543,0.052697375,0.080671765,0.004003044,-0.016667338,-0.04998489,-0.03652178,0.07685797,0.06557773,0.002952122,-0.109757185,0.07957094,-0.1029213,0.01859135,0.056856997,-0.026757188,-0.09573964,-0.07806153,-0.07723622,0.022755427,-0.07735136,-0.00015854613,-0.027981993,0.0160279,0.033369895,-0.045299374,0.028138284,0.061795548,-5.2827763e-33,-0.082079805,0.011507659,0.0022932386,0.13986184,-0.07458808,-0.033706486,0.013381536,-0.048737727,0.03503994,0.014307502,-0.04570941,-0.007453972,-0.0050468296,0.00413328,0.021238398,-0.0063506686,-0.073398545,-0.02432606,0.0030176865,0.07398891,0.027999038,0.13736154,0.0010188469,-0.016505804,-0.08511846,0.08556681,-0.01092399,-0.051638674,0.012596118,-0.038377084,0.006239434,0.036478624,-0.02453032,-0.04853701,0.008707759,-0.004727521,0.027484428,-0.07848725,0.0054806992,0.108435884,0.010460655,0.08089937,-0.048707787,-0.03429603,-0.004537908,0.017777277,0.058875613,0.005030686,0.09118384,-0.04649702,-0.010481472,0.035620544,-0.0484085,0.06978673,-0.02909349,-0.03370493,-0.09288782,-0.03036881,-0.032234564,0.12880717,-0.046463557,-0.01497666,0.014707028,0.094267756,-0.0071346783,-0.042257447,0.015495625,0.002807051,-0.0053104893,0.08384275,0.005705897,-0.044809718,0.08204646,-0.0024223218,-0.03949698,-0.027290389,0.018671807,-0.07295019,-0.05533351,0.006616916,0.0079623405,-0.033295635,-0.013104956,0.012972389,-0.15806776,0.002394653,0.062380716,0.042521507,0.018989958,-0.015023818,-0.0035349473,0.029115543,-0.06638101,-0.07370659,-0.02266735,-6.826929e-08,-0.027714383,-0.026346358,-0.03298509,0.03889883,-0.067880556,-0.029334687,-0.045795802,0.0047755847,-0.06911893,0.011286574,0.032511957,0.04341669,-0.053648364,0.02905349,-0.019486347,0.0094398055,0.054091237,0.11695957,-0.0137186255,0.07988939,0.051042955,0.025119297,-0.021644467,-0.004931438,0.019656084,-0.035211645,-0.008338277,0.08692096,0.037609078,0.06649157,0.058169194,0.03466916,0.04291089,-0.058871936,0.058650948,0.08603277,0.0012912747,-0.011734762,0.03431795,0.06677774,-0.053177748,0.026531015,-0.06448056,0.025054505,0.08413276,-0.0105758095,0.02980247,-0.027315384,-0.053905163,-0.110321045,0.06743751,-0.005059434,-0.1062165,0.03018304,-0.030350361,-0.022552457,-0.055268385,0.045751393,0.017088445,-0.040743534,0.045717303,-0.021923132,0.045505732,-0.0720057,1,-9.445684,-0.5315287,1

384,"first of all sir reviewed what we learned before about statistics. the we learned about tools to analyze data, what they do, and how they are connected. then sir talked about using graphs to show data and where mistakes can happen. then we learned about beta and beta 0 and how they are used in models. then we learned what the p-value is and why it helps in choosing the right features. then we started learning about anova (analysis of variance) and the f-statistic. then we talked about why a bigger f-statistic means a better model.  
then sir told us how to use these ideas in real life.

433,"in today's class we discussed about data analysis. we learned about the time series data analysis, which we perform for limited data i.e. when the data is insufficient beyond a certain time for prediction.
we also discussed other types of distributions like small scale distributions- in which the sample may follow a uniform distribution than gaussian one. 
outcome distribution - when we have a large number of unknown variables then the outcome distribution follows gaussian (normal) distribution.
then we also discussed about regression analysis:- 
error decomposition: sst = sse + ssr , where sst is total sum of squares, sse is sum of squares of errors, ssr is regression of this sum of squares. we also talked about coefficient of determination(r2) = 1- (sse/sst) 
now, correlation coefficient (r): 
this indicates the strength of linear relationship, like higher the mod(r) , stronger the relation and vice versa.
we also discussed about some examples of this +ve and -ve correlation. we also used the software to make ",-0.13328424,0.0052946303,-0.024391528,0.10626342,0.022774944,0.019023769,-0.04044779,0.057995316,0.091774106,0.019114308,-0.0020439911,0.11790037,0.028798833,0.097095944,-0.053789414,-0.10651887,0.022617295,-0.017103385,0.00067816186,-0.069342606,0.05957316,-0.010492792,-0.13506094,0.027847713,0.06917166,-0.0034801208,0.007717315,-0.07994912,-0.05241157,0.05442232,0.05294928,-0.014062183,-0.0061768307,0.030217107,-0.14845707,-0.024588829,0.035369504,0.094523184,0.0028423874,0.0021472636,-0.023098882,0.027064662,0.01978553,0.048369464,0.015357611,-0.047196824,0.031128986,-0.159281,-0.096357726,0.029409975,-0.11377807,0.07196478,-0.0069834148,0.0029713975,0.07927205,-0.03585734,-0.0055635488,-0.015570093,0.011810699,0.047555905,0.042453796,-0.06927628,-0.078150414,0.040116444,0.043708373,0.025435107,-0.010744135,0.05314955,0.019165069,-0.0012335308,-0.12642404,0.08950059,-0.12077762,0.06928548,-0.029261993,0.033840027,-0.012829807,-0.00281678,0.007771526,-0.044104237,0.04553183,0.075217105,0.029417604,0.014718817,0.023294237,0.053920794,0.028912308,0.02567751,-0.06523745,0.017647142,0.115669005,0.030704139,0.011575017,0.011083414,0.008597096,0.00056451844,-0.015470181,-0.0767047,0.13468058,0.013997346,0.010155273,0.062543534,0.03133231,-0.015939327,0.0048672855,-0.057806198,0.066114746,-0.074684024,-0.010170266,0.0062979506,-0.069141895,0.0034890934,-0.091701806,-0.017386328,-0.00050857,-0.015980354,-0.09674055,0.034834225,-0.070482895,0.06955843,0.02931303,-0.018154062,-0.018820973,-0.0052812207,0.08852261,0.07071286,-0.09256731,5.065834e-33,-0.017344097,-0.056338828,-0.041445155,0.08756548,-0.03638516,-0.015908476,-0.067011714,-0.015333836,0.07365924,0.0994262,0.04473637,0.05056945,-0.04961735,-0.0032180622,0.049341056,0.11921011,-0.014465276,0.067184165,0.02150786,-0.010903853,0.05568326,-0.06765328,0.09334297,0.025348563,0.039837554,-0.057909753,0.04062015,-0.023801088,-0.046599984,-0.0022464485,-0.013345078,0.026264122,-0.05552661,-0.036396183,0.023525191,-0.059710857,0.040184468,-0.038186017,-0.0037438408,0.041788287,0.008871039,0.022747194,0.00528981,0.0022756276,0.034319654,0.0194388,0.078979045,-0.018607011,0.09641643,-0.02053467,-0.07278777,-0.037773345,-0.0276373,-0.022657106,-0.029062215,0.14334509,-0.04269429,-0.08245335,-0.026618566,0.026743488,-0.09047803,0.003664323,-0.027072847,-0.1330314,-0.0028705741,0.05322611,-0.04501649,-0.00903274,0.03117655,0.04943721,0.038563058,-0.026513413,-0.004833803,-0.020487718,0.0928573,-0.026937826,0.046035413,0.011193782,0.0030593816,-0.017989147,-0.07555785,-0.053505108,0.03341437,-0.066628814,-0.065623,-0.016187783,-0.00027627603,0.034634046,-0.052321818,-0.08473403,-0.063376114,0.029370954,-0.012471562,0.022365976,-0.05351771,-5.9248383e-33,-0.06366431,0.019596826,-0.02161326,-0.010434995,0.048859138,0.010947916,-0.07110816,0.033230886,0.0724038,-0.021547794,-0.017137349,-0.073848985,0.080426656,0.08144747,0.0093413405,0.0007337402,0.0050325743,-0.06415509,-0.058921892,-0.029880727,-0.0058258874,0.027466796,0.022724932,-0.13078743,0.02941776,0.032898575,-0.030498948,0.06571454,-0.07272803,0.034104396,-0.006324231,-0.014970077,-0.017478332,-0.0102514485,-0.08440587,0.023327818,0.047338348,-0.022954313,0.005351546,-0.060352143,0.06540578,0.07726331,0.082901165,-0.09120986,0.018409444,-0.03963042,-0.00023242684,0.04484289,0.032442596,0.010297357,0.022340847,0.054249752,-0.052157883,0.016166234,-0.005642486,-0.038500343,-0.002227904,-0.014553822,-0.061627187,0.060276244,0.017187074,-0.028484847,-0.0147432815,0.056085836,-0.07839741,0.048340008,-0.012637452,-0.045025464,0.02326285,-0.00015302685,0.034910794,-0.016900992,-0.018079814,-0.014382375,-0.02788142,-0.003394538,-0.031008512,-0.034346584,-0.05589345,0.069061704,-0.0047665928,0.047283046,0.05824009,-0.06320456,-0.03192963,0.03786217,0.0073268414,-0.024612062,0.076154396,-0.020107472,-0.11346495,-0.021723473,-0.041116495,0.017316654,0.05728264,-6.8307635e-08,-0.0075554303,-0.045722254,0.07904676,-0.030845841,0.010888949,-0.052058816,0.004607957,0.03393568,-0.053193208,0.02262751,0.062800154,-0.014870564,-0.10112235,-0.001134287,0.0843226,-0.008261696,0.03990234,-0.004119251,-0.030199012,-0.035663463,0.041145544,-0.040796865,-0.013244852,0.024764812,0.031135337,0.009088509,-0.021336282,0.0071935244,-0.016446713,0.037946507,-0.033220004,0.021423245,0.041959945,-0.018873844,0.054301824,-0.0063695516,0.028757138,0.022471769,-0.04628149,0.058725383,-0.028116364,0.037177928,-0.03171804,0.064374395,0.043295313,0.02115448,0.030879362,0.008386495,0.03039684,-0.058198925,0.06798022,-0.051497962,-0.054086067,0.0010075602,0.030674376,0.08650021,-0.0052701235,-0.0032322747,-0.0570794,-0.031588655,0.02216178,0.0498931,-0.006188477,-0.056685556,10,-19.552572,16.217588,1
438,"in our last session, we had continued to follow up on our statistical concepts based on the background we had developed earlier. we explored terms from our data analysis toolpack, discussed their meanings, interconnections, how to represent them graphically, and the potential sources of uncertainty or errors in applying them.
the significant portion of the class was assigned to understanding cases involving beta and beta 0 under specific conditions, with emphasis on how they feature in different statistical models. we also went ahead and introduced discussion on the concept of the p-value, bringing into light its role on critical decisions especially regarding feature selection.
at the end of the class, we started to touch on anova, or analysis of variance, and focused on the f-statistic. we discussed why it was important for this value to be large, also relating to how it relates to evaluating model performance.",0.0044232244,0.045063093,-0.018880209,0.031270206,0.03100944,0.05151946,0.047593646,0.14858325,0.043282937,0.04039832,-0.058740146,0.058231123,-0.043392718,-0.0049418304,-0.023107922,-0.060858913,0.06817334,-0.04833178,-0.08570587,0.034694493,-0.058473337,-0.037545744,0.053403012,0.035362236,-0.018624999,-0.020714276,-0.041583445,0.052091416,0.008567657,-0.022199076,-0.050468545,0.07844922,0.05342883,0.018594708,-0.04699508,0.0053248676,0.012617098,0.019211266,0.016666485,0.053548384,-0.032928247,-0.08959223,0.020407205,0.0049616196,0.052623473,-0.09903874,-0.029001374,-0.012453037,-0.032763045,0.010457206,-0.096740566,-0.0064020487,-0.14909026,-0.021717887,-0.04752593,0.010461599,0.035856012,-0.06564959,0.004197997,0.012350639,0.00018778129,-0.028952243,-0.039858922,0.11660903,0.054392338,-0.0004185533,-0.024023058,-0.059459694,0.023665495,0.046547104,-0.04095759,0.05150113,-0.06904015,0.027145417,0.037071142,-0.032569867,-0.009206616,0.060145114,0.022017384,-0.028338805,0.05044846,-0.000951353,-0.034523778,0.003943652,0.03988347,0.0027757306,-0.026146978,0.025144119,-0.056422707,0.03836887,-1.3635398e-05,0.007371735,-0.059033725,0.05425837,-0.0065312865,0.07414743,-0.043271553,-0.10214099,0.057283077,0.050757416,-0.013878538,0.041398358,0.0313873,-0.024699524,-0.024093853,-0.06402415,-0.012068189,-0.08270268,-0.0047912104,-0.022683285,-0.08954534,-0.028472152,-0.054939367,0.017701399,0.037144586,-0.004061807,-0.03999149,0.06366592,0.036786698,0.038349126,0.07268616,-0.028443243,0.007969009,0.007711605,0.0005808708,0.017327242,-0.15114988,1.7353193e-33,0.030916678,-0.02610627,0.01147148,0.12527809,-0.04169755,0.005872558,-0.0143367145,-0.052815296,0.003952745,0.028550165,-0.011700251,0.042762693,-0.003227447,-0.023476455,0.09427758,0.03662801,-0.083495416,0.048552003,-0.028911939,0.00943848,0.10970224,-0.0697468,0.04224185,0.0008869344,0.05980892,0.07050697,-0.06273845,0.022457331,-0.11935136,0.024647474,-0.051762775,0.032996193,-0.018005546,-0.01721402,-0.03929846,-0.014271763,-0.015316037,-0.049825944,0.02864454,-0.013503925,-0.061783493,0.004713611,-0.051257465,0.0056582945,0.024162441,-0.002502023,0.027655052,-0.01636676,-0.002065521,0.012826784,-0.056767996,-0.017262219,0.040469155,0.019972589,-0.09282396,0.053284697,-0.06353908,-0.017631933,-0.16909143,0.029633073,-0.016677396,0.094939165,-0.007809461,-0.07868769,-0.07889425,0.06616879,0.01794287,0.06900824,0.021470243,-0.055203162,-0.008779154,0.009308347,-0.027748197,-0.049634833,0.04983965,0.0039823893,0.062069558,-0.0009776361,0.0045861383,-0.0617697,-0.037496552,-0.07165481,-0.029436659,-0.050823428,-0.016195575,-0.008174035,0.09656854,-0.007325649,0.00022875932,-0.044124797,0.029774668,0.06422361,-0.02669048,0.014939202,-0.008306865,-5.7462113e-33,-0.092129774,0.02712236,-0.036619637,0.07524133,0.015528183,-0.0315145,0.003787691,-0.09880962,0.0026994294,-0.022419523,-0.06727695,0.004930836,-0.003747562,-0.118686795,-0.038398754,-0.012698652,-0.037203807,-0.10047427,-0.008326252,0.029402565,0.065309376,0.10049356,-0.048098348,-0.00985878,-0.11363243,0.037438907,-0.03372198,-0.07235095,0.0053407615,-0.06776587,-0.0056424704,0.026480395,-0.019080862,-0.040013116,-0.0012284942,0.004708307,0.06979756,-0.005203629,0.054481965,0.12435246,0.08132176,0.08723186,-0.024878193,-0.031820785,0.067205735,0.028681716,0.07086174,0.014727672,0.026147753,-0.089142404,0.05817154,0.01754501,-0.016251327,0.045941997,-0.06650729,0.0074145026,0.0243196,-0.073946126,-0.013269344,0.15781106,-0.00717897,-0.03726601,-0.022194648,0.046389908,-0.04904688,-0.008054002,-0.011190802,-0.042525765,0.0022510025,0.025384197,-0.013072416,-0.058451697,0.01826724,0.033563353,-0.05214006,-0.03722582,-0.02801863,-0.019716196,0.009884193,0.08892312,-0.038788743,0.013850187,-0.039949946,-0.024472965,-0.026053397,-0.009509678,-0.0034386457,0.050533775,0.043613303,-0.08984303,-0.068548106,0.07023253,-0.07100669,-0.034045156,0.03531737,-6.095264e-08,0.055592097,0.013089093,0.0691722,0.052891962,0.08298828,-0.018008228,-0.037573986,0.050706636,-0.028425982,0.03882945,-0.017605964,0.06131035,-0.054617908,0.043472685,0.04290932,0.032470737,0.0646243,0.06816442,-0.021162784,0.0012719418,0.09473595,-0.043006323,-0.0488148,-0.062439386,0.05072977,-0.081180416,-0.057666976,0.045331262,0.008887325,0.055341102,-0.004994455,0.08619827,0.011568608,-0.070870906,0.0455686,0.08019496,0.0533192,-0.038972456,0.0036870341,0.048066903,-0.025468342,-0.0013233052,-0.018837906,0.07619997,0.0037617264,0.007452,-0.029865284,0.025030596,0.007234685,-0.064360686,0.01910383,0.016370535,-0.11973,0.002615915,-0.044383194,0.11798067,0.012752515,0.011354297,-0.023197802,-0.13768488,0.0709784,-0.014952613,-0.080680676,-0.012386586,1,-14.783411,1.7165992,1

we continued (by mainly looking at different statistical conditions) where we had stopped in the last class, and discussed the terms coming up from our extension (data analysis toolpack) and then looked at their interconnections and terminologies, what these values mean, their graphical interpretation, and conclusions with certain errors or uncertainties which come along with it.
we looked at a few cases of beta and beta 0, and their different specific case conditions
some of these terms were the p-value (and itâ€™s basic use, like it helps in our selection of feature selection) 
we also looked at multiple linear regression, and how some of the terms coming in our table were mainly relevant for multiple linear regression. we also looked at what the term anova means and the

556,"firstly we got to know about some algorithms by which assignments are checked.the idea is to find the similarity between the answers.then we studied about multiple linear regression where our dependent variable depends on many independent variables, also called features. these features are represented as a vector (x1 x2 ... xn).its general equation is y=b0+b1x1+b2x2+...+bnxn
apart from r and p values there is another statistical parameter, f value, by which we can infer how good the model is. f value is the ratio of explained variance to unexplained variance so higher is the f value, better is the prediction. we took some dataset and calculated the error metrics and other parameters. from this we learnt that since there is no reference point for f-value so rather than calling a particular f value as a good value it makes more sense to compare f values for two models and conclude that the one with the higher f value is a better

563,"we continued to follow up on our statistical concepts. we explored terms from our data analysis toolpack, discussed their meanings, interconnections, how to represent them graphically, and the potential sources of uncertainty or errors in applying them.
the significant portion of the class covers cases involving beta and beta 0 under specific conditions, with emphasis on how they feature in different statistical models. discussed the concept of the p-value, bringing into light its role on critical decisions especially regarding feature selection.
at the end of the class, we started to touch on anova, or analysis of variance, and focused on the f-statistic. we discussed why it was important for this value to be large, also relating to how it

we discussed how the code is written, the lines and their applications. we also analysized the regression results which these lines of code gave us. the durbin watson test was also one of the one returned by the python code.",-0.057830866,0.028127946,0.13169786,0.06834369,0.10115526,-0.08473141,-0.08985619,0.07035025,-0.0998215,0.011049197,0.027276533,0.056382276,-0.06734195,0.009576209,0.08563657,0.014452586,-0.073562935,-0.06672628,-0.026305256,-0.07304992,-0.0023833893,0.0030039246,-0.057232503,0.0018021617,0.09516569,0.01360183,0.019036787,0.0027856794,-0.041367617,0.00666049,-0.04641888,0.0946335,-0.07637254,-0.0011758017,0.029755274,-0.02456424,0.0831269,0.013439488,0.005107965,0.0098364195,0.020751283,-0.09028028,-0.032849405,0.031588916,-0.024162365,0.0608069,-0.07213125,0.035147585,-0.009700378,-0.041462265,-0.03803927,0.082294345,-0.030693397,0.014801739,0.006026711,-0.05165817,-0.021632334,0.021314094,0.00019271213,-0.04156405,-0.03446434,-0.0063423826,-0.054637276,0.0447537,0.052668907,0.010877224,-0.026737187,-0.010629337,0.0363037,0.01335478,-0.08702167,0.049312137,-0.015221193,0.02108766,0.046394683,-0.10183008,0.03449162,-0.06511887,0.011412905,-0.034874503,-0.0030586417,0.014367388,-0.091609,0.022408232,0.010637202,-0.08173763,0.017656833,0.025825566,-0.1041266,-0.05021447,0.12058155,-0.053249136,0.02397012,0.075782776,-0.040489938,0.07830495,0.028918985,-0.027259115,0.039540615,0.07388828,0.007602408,0.019171763,0.027823025,0.003436891,0.0061175926,-0.03129514,0.01777237,-0.1154642,0.076767355,0.026545309,-0.017383672,-0.0390948,-0.043499645,-0.064398505,0.019973395,0.012013102,-0.07604747,0.05879514,-0.08039719,0.053269193,-0.028755559,-0.00054266804,-0.012966909,0.03320817,-0.011806405,0.052353036,-0.07819395,6.980534e-33,-0.00082639465,-0.075764924,-0.00986404,-0.044931978,0.04072889,-0.0196463,-0.0086824065,0.039759617,-0.042260762,0.0029465582,-0.08642326,-0.0019740707,-0.03626212,-0.019589549,-0.02314735,-0.03833056,-0.06537458,0.103901535,-0.018562788,0.09261603,0.042372547,-0.026825946,0.024609355,-0.0005892754,0.02563665,0.017421816,-0.049761094,0.013882178,0.025909694,0.041022643,-0.10936185,0.06305004,-0.028466217,0.013030783,-0.00904228,-0.024545008,-0.040377863,-0.058920927,0.030718306,-0.036109056,-0.071607664,0.035273183,-0.0061796173,-0.041636605,-0.0643029,-0.043839768,-0.02767422,0.0032276548,-0.023490915,0.044078838,-0.030526048,-0.021991996,-0.027732313,0.036390334,-0.088241056,0.048091315,0.041875117,-0.06490018,-0.01058662,-0.004318219,0.108349055,0.051823106,-0.014116032,-0.11345931,-0.038285367,0.021895614,0.07404517,0.07745354,-0.0160827,0.086680226,-0.039086122,0.008080557,-0.07854081,-0.05143683,0.080396734,-0.001723017,0.07010443,0.06887115,0.09011858,-0.029016033,0.058209058,-0.031595964,0.12901472,-0.09363327,-0.038493693,0.028440144,0.027723417,-0.01155214,-0.07560699,-0.04526894,-0.05026266,0.01451478,0.047920126,0.008941142,0.058593985,-7.307307e-33,-0.059744783,0.038781893,-0.0044258847,0.0460236,-0.014260485,0.012038004,0.032341924,0.050913885,0.0048025935,-0.01340829,0.04606335,-0.062263407,0.043503493,-0.009280843,0.04016615,0.024201859,-0.016190393,-0.024457617,0.015029336,0.023340244,0.010537137,0.076899454,-0.047440242,-0.022600854,-0.061029907,-0.050869755,0.032881096,-0.079631835,0.016253728,-0.078969575,-0.047631193,0.058108777,-0.10488316,0.0630418,0.044516005,-0.013363177,-0.012548477,-0.049032748,-0.009101503,0.018067637,0.10899015,0.10764051,-0.07029426,0.008135943,0.0009124624,0.032258015,-0.029947205,0.095590346,0.06460457,0.007938062,0.018529167,0.0033488085,-0.021831488,0.007861518,-0.07780229,0.03557307,0.01759593,0.02694525,-0.082138665,0.00044894492,-0.15615714,-0.053204015,0.015637787,0.000431186,0.037028804,0.013811264,-0.033206087,-0.001685657,0.017235242,-0.030637415,0.0030649286,-0.0045300657,0.0020508035,-0.042055055,-0.024494553,0.0056284177,-0.089151524,-0.088297345,-0.063665636,0.086139545,-0.0150213875,-0.022976696,-0.0048923315,0.074313074,-0.048759446,0.040636804,0.010220967,0.0005408787,0.023526343,0.014842606,-0.05312257,0.064936504,-0.053478148,0.11251713,-0.0048173685,-5.75524e-08,0.0123178065,0.01958666,0.0058334763,0.11525574,0.020446584,-0.021881921,-0.010308565,0.10156593,-0.0025570078,0.055033386,0.011032522,-0.013325388,-0.08381689,0.035290882,0.0071446,0.027420582,0.0025416124,0.04225542,-0.027933264,-0.0333306,0.08188297,-0.009321491,0.02135657,0.04635259,-0.007428782,-0.016596267,0.012299734,0.13489397,-0.033907536,-0.09455063,-0.036115628,-0.01740144,-0.03289482,-0.05623126,0.1085014,0.10778871,0.021559475,0.004148994,0.0076083504,0.053045213,-0.026983768,0.025139738,-0.02326593,0.040252693,0.06302771,0.025261838,-0.0051195,-0.008966421,0.051776133,-0.04345264,0.10440891,0.03501312,-0.016619563,-0.012799963,0.052978724,0.074585,-0.082900405,0.04310439,-0.060068425,-0.07458814,0.0041492325,-0.0119259395,0.032170232,0.013716905,1,-7.870785,7.614969,1
665,"today, we continued our discussion on statistical significance before shifting focus to python, with assigned tutorials to prepare for our next class.  

we explored how data science algorithms evaluate session summaries using a relative strength method, calculating distances between submissions based on scatter plot coefficients.  

later, we studied multiple linear regression, where a dependent variable is influenced by multiple independent variables. we learned about the f-value, which measures model effectiveness by comparing explained and unexplained varianceâ€”a higher f-value indicating a better model. using a dataset, we calculated error metrics and compared f-values to assess model performance
