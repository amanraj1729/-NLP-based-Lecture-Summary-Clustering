11,"problem with heatmap is that they don't capture sufficient information but they play important role when we have multiple parameters and it is not feasible to plot all parameters therefore heatmap helps in pair wise analysis.variance influence factor explain a parameter based other all other parameters excluding itself cif  is xi=f( xj not equals xi ) indentify the vif of the features of the vif is greater than threshold then remove it principle component analysis is an application of singular value decomposition principle component are necessarily orthogonal to each other and can be equal to the dimension of the data but if we have for say 10 principle component we can decide which parameters we will choose to continue with if we have 2 dimensional data and we do pca then it may get converted to one dimension hence help in reducing the dimensionality of the data pcs are the weighted sum of all the parameters and the weights are known as loading in general vif needs to do first as multicollinearity is a big problem than pca . pca helps you with predictions but we cannot do what if/ sensitivity type of analysis like how much u changes when we change a x(parameter) as they are not real parameters. pca has  multiple uses dimension reduction , prediction models ,  visualization( during eda) for the purpose of understanding the data , captures variance , data reduction ( data compression without loosing too much of data ), it is sensitive to data scaling therefore we have to normalize the data , tsne  follows t distribution it is stochastic in nature and gradient descent is involved in this , it is a lossy transformation ( we loose exactness of data  but we get relative closeness of the data

99,"we learned that if we have a large number of features, then the correlation matrix is a good way to understand the pairwise relation between the parameters. 
then we compared the variance inflation factor(vif) of all the parameters.
then we aimed to reduce the parameters to reduce the complexity and computation power. we can do it by calculating the vif and removing parameters that have very high vif values. this helps reduce the complexity by minimal change in the model's accuracy.
then we studied principal component analysis. the no of principal components is equal to the dimensions of the dataset. all the principal components are orthogonal to each other.
then we understood the elbow diagram and came to know how many principal components are actually required to have a 95% confidence interval. we then accordingly removed features to simplify the dataset.
we then had a discussion about which thing to do first, vif or principal component analysis. we came to the conclusion that doing vif first is beneficial because multicollinearity is important to remove. 
also, we saw that we can write y as a function of principal components.
we do principal component analysis for three main reasons- dimension reduction, prediction models, and visualization.
then we had a look at t-distribution and t-distributed stochastic neighbour encoding(t-sne). it is a machine-learning algorithm for dimension reduction and data visualization. its main advantage is the ability to preserve local structure.",0.059809785,-0.052502792,0.0067961263,-0.025619488,0.0108995335,0.019823734,-0.049214642,0.007811426,0.090047516,-0.0028829356,0.030268317,0.025343662,-0.04722633,0.053531773,-0.02226095,-0.049042773,0.058794502,0.02607011,-0.071105905,-0.012757262,0.011533219,-9.023884e-05,-0.0014486128,-0.03122078,-0.010426592,0.020759882,0.007596614,-0.0018099092,-0.01517877,-0.0046955883,0.032491777,0.070693985,-0.0109851835,-0.045208458,-0.08652597,0.0067472314,0.10805216,0.07165456,-0.06337409,0.04636452,-0.003028535,0.06218622,0.042007033,0.07031032,0.11105594,0.045575432,-0.03235294,-0.073217034,0.0037849816,-0.03908036,-0.054660533,0.043931715,-0.07903124,-0.016766885,-0.03637935,-0.034098394,-0.022987202,-0.10454104,-0.031678434,0.024807213,0.0011501105,-0.011142037,0.022525767,-0.01003355,0.113505825,-0.020677418,0.007316183,-0.04941298,-0.009087029,0.03206954,-0.09021299,0.0002555274,-0.086620264,-0.015785785,-0.034496915,0.10132011,-0.04825966,0.0055629946,0.05315945,-0.019089205,0.07008203,0.16531797,0.0066610184,0.040692173,0.0074505345,0.040398955,-0.010477648,-0.032982852,-0.106841445,-0.013701134,0.13803837,0.039999697,0.012339544,-0.056590363,0.042975634,0.085931934,0.0033953746,-0.103381835,-0.025105348,0.008752322,0.018016277,-0.073629685,0.09223256,-0.02165653,-0.08206358,-0.057385314,0.00832485,0.038290538,0.032880522,-0.02987833,-0.01841273,-0.015006526,-0.107267134,0.0061829435,0.058601033,0.05584152,-0.0587975,0.039344456,0.11281724,0.03666493,-0.017997304,0.03988358,0.052984297,0.03907036,0.024744881,0.027265973,-0.107231624,5.090323e-33,0.031848453,0.047863916,-0.00856989,0.019972695,-0.043765165,-0.002207402,0.04147771,-0.073035,0.07980585,0.070649415,-0.055551495,0.022170257,-0.005961137,0.05112368,0.02847618,0.0017505345,-0.019414352,0.048603963,-0.024731385,-0.054460317,0.080845326,-0.031259842,0.07374588,0.03569793,-0.020483663,-0.0372824,-0.023247097,-0.010511141,-0.10447887,-0.017037679,-0.09093838,0.096955456,-0.0909214,0.05355493,-0.03108775,-0.11394152,-0.0026062543,-0.09205182,0.0708086,-0.036255658,0.010440528,0.035391748,0.017177984,-0.02528905,0.03667958,0.06713174,0.028919103,0.009652459,-0.017830873,0.023794847,0.015113216,0.04399289,0.02729831,-0.04129434,-0.033175018,0.091354564,0.007882973,-0.052478936,-0.017200809,0.015526238,-0.112140924,0.008134973,-0.03513728,-0.03616701,-0.04126467,0.016806176,-0.07076721,0.0031847341,0.024355914,0.0031313433,-0.05323491,-0.04773475,-0.024638323,-0.07779606,0.016174,-0.053924404,-0.0436291,0.07784553,-0.007741892,-0.007601462,-0.1015972,0.07223635,-0.0057975105,-0.033439,0.07962989,-0.04721895,0.08619215,-0.0428294,-0.008734657,-0.054789044,-0.004950123,0.08074014,0.048017845,-0.006347179,-0.0035322881,-4.449897e-33,-0.021110104,-0.00019428157,0.014089552,0.035594482,0.028080773,-0.10235393,-0.024189858,-0.060892396,0.008503589,-0.13854256,0.03499925,-0.04437111,-0.025980065,-0.037643995,0.08357037,0.066588484,-0.013910331,-0.029577216,-0.0037666874,-0.054853324,0.024841668,-0.039600078,-0.0057352437,-0.057536628,-0.049541395,-0.045320373,-0.002926119,-0.0696202,-0.053945553,-0.0053427494,-0.07872601,0.016856786,-0.0601273,0.04991804,-0.0027002401,-0.017153561,-0.057818547,-0.046183378,0.022813665,0.03466056,0.054643646,0.049291193,0.008819547,-0.051533796,-0.009227826,-0.0063609355,0.03362665,0.020969728,-0.02218172,-0.005901743,0.029529534,0.029203437,0.05310316,-0.0409457,-0.0052721696,0.0233217,0.13119948,-0.045652017,0.11030874,-0.003357659,0.025963869,-0.00053551316,-0.054959416,0.013488949,0.027639775,0.0032198983,0.049144868,-0.04424407,-0.014406604,0.004539465,0.0012885225,-0.010787606,0.059543617,-0.05583617,-0.019102143,-0.039863937,-0.017100973,-0.017911304,0.009250773,0.030042144,-0.029203797,0.010620689,-0.012985208,0.0039009978,0.01651279,0.10140547,0.032037996,-0.028800623,0.047186036,-0.005816578,-0.008655258,-0.019044058,0.01700066,0.07819967,0.050738934,-6.074541e-08,-0.07511929,0.025616642,-0.045986675,-0.0798981,0.059622698,-0.018337369,-0.0036205812,0.16737477,0.036014616,0.063077085,0.16348226,-0.033616174,-0.078540795,0.039886992,0.08273693,0.015402397,0.037589807,0.07295936,-0.02759418,-0.07906796,0.08929473,-0.07368664,0.011238877,0.02012284,0.07490558,-0.03273509,0.037270848,0.086505994,0.024167053,0.05333773,-0.03669975,-0.072758794,0.035499133,0.004993004,0.021937992,0.03189936,0.031351812,-0.03353742,-0.011960386,0.013151685,-0.082191385,0.061051443,-0.013431344,-0.016367292,0.072160885,0.012102926,0.020008985,0.03593332,0.009431074,0.03807509,-0.04272816,0.01343958,-0.026555266,0.10351437,-0.035352387,0.022117943,0.029130924,0.024377735,-0.07107528,0.004310139,-0.0033041362,0.032474753,-0.059164517,-0.0554381,2,20.072412,17.1349,11
100,"today covered principal component analysis (pca) and its role in simplifying data while keeping the most valuable information. we started by looking at why itâ€™s important to remove correlated factors using the variance inflation factor (vif) before applying pca. from there, we explored how principal components (pcs) capture variance and how the elbow method helps determine the right number of pcs to use. we also discussed practical applications, like using pca for exploratory data analysis (eda), improving predictive models, and making data easier to interpret. a comparison between standard regression and principal component regression highlighted how pca can enhance model performance. we wrapped up by discussing its real-world impact and why itâ€™s such a useful tool in data analysis.",0.008047753,-0.024277253,0.0021081262,0.034636892,0.07867081,0.04875456,-0.017358705,-0.009681631,0.06790043,0.034707684,0.03144409,0.08198746,-0.074700475,0.035147555,-0.03182741,-0.041537073,0.07526443,-0.007948717,-0.055824444,-0.04080809,-0.0192542,-0.024042048,-0.052527867,0.02198949,0.024860883,0.0651434,0.013264799,-0.018679142,-0.031155804,0.023870755,0.029821288,0.060220517,0.015310678,-0.035973065,-0.085997544,0.019425457,0.06614877,0.08856014,-0.07886944,-0.01604351,0.02480608,-0.009604993,-0.011092569,0.042278893,0.13405578,-0.01668074,-0.038426243,-0.07863699,0.025345068,-0.0006278398,-0.0353135,-0.032085724,0.03778562,-0.016482932,-0.03157435,-0.007900322,-0.0034133866,-0.020672126,0.034122963,0.023783997,-0.023291701,-0.032881323,0.017775837,0.02004139,0.06917274,-0.040206518,0.016910793,-0.010804012,-0.06852268,0.0072970698,-0.07836095,0.06139781,-0.054849736,0.0200278,0.041225124,0.08437766,-0.052360244,-0.030513441,0.09347017,0.026460374,0.022551518,0.113827206,-0.03877434,0.017443115,0.02100598,0.030211791,0.036827322,-0.07055731,-0.06541389,-0.0020943691,0.08944357,0.058243837,0.08501128,-0.0045724106,-0.008461971,0.03347587,0.014144294,-0.09989433,-0.010538624,0.02681946,0.017235164,0.020301023,0.01752397,0.0121944435,-0.09162127,-0.12656237,0.036164597,0.009406278,0.033782862,0.0030170244,-0.04861756,-0.017094966,-0.051472332,-0.04894007,0.073745206,-0.04645282,-0.007931313,0.033394836,0.037816692,0.030521344,0.004526302,-0.0376057,0.058104992,0.039163142,0.054502916,0.021492146,-0.09062472,6.1047595e-33,0.054798722,0.014598411,0.015591392,0.012838766,-0.0011517857,-0.07804901,-0.0052506193,-0.048617862,0.07830393,0.056523647,0.012056542,0.0954762,-0.014588984,0.04550238,0.04100905,0.028268266,-0.0637247,0.11884153,-0.011800269,-0.010280408,0.07378906,-0.08215873,0.053165175,-0.047736626,-0.030472498,0.010466987,-0.0341946,-0.013860654,-0.00767858,-0.010860437,-0.033749018,0.020227447,-0.08359193,0.031140657,-0.057272304,-0.06312616,0.022556903,-0.12483348,0.10762163,0.024623029,-0.025651779,0.028767003,0.039999917,-0.08081793,-0.03887311,0.0708703,0.0056740995,-0.049360447,0.00920586,0.033133794,0.035741575,0.037942305,0.009588512,-0.0007858186,-0.078512624,0.08328484,0.010860579,-0.09531425,0.029440481,-0.04980449,-0.09488478,0.06279883,-0.006324695,-0.046015576,-0.07284403,-0.062004298,0.050858267,0.052386932,-0.023396796,0.011590596,-0.030129028,-0.0412498,-0.034695353,-0.022775969,0.019027213,-0.06878829,-0.02865283,0.0043442277,-0.0012129253,0.0017874804,-0.063611716,0.050243836,0.040321995,-0.07576745,0.038742933,-0.065789275,0.017000357,-0.09857565,-0.015888158,-0.08199752,-0.03869638,0.06482174,0.04133026,-0.0038465308,0.014875052,-5.8533646e-33,-0.054979682,0.025146987,0.017397286,0.044986088,0.046064742,-0.08391465,-0.031919897,-0.02202439,0.02852852,-0.07228986,0.034229048,-0.030114537,0.016076166,0.039329514,0.119034395,0.05791419,0.00450005,-0.027021509,-0.028931208,-0.09285284,-0.017759483,-0.097095706,0.020002488,-0.051375553,-0.043546442,-0.06470065,-0.009593203,-0.05841344,-0.053409804,-0.09433765,-0.071158536,0.07075993,-0.06181663,0.04708312,-0.039603896,0.0010406524,-0.076498345,-0.081570424,0.017928585,0.0614915,0.10417778,0.05962172,0.009728388,-0.011242715,-0.031693812,-0.032385238,0.036499944,0.08674331,0.04334197,0.03874815,0.03469214,0.03402343,0.024193956,-0.01780649,0.015343388,-0.021892522,0.14448012,-0.039283823,0.035268497,0.026350873,0.048400406,0.008820557,-0.03292788,0.043320447,-0.014932141,-0.040818356,0.036935464,-0.060333177,-0.062201288,-0.02513865,0.044911914,-0.027635427,-0.012993989,0.037734173,-0.060204968,-0.029225226,0.0015698681,0.01677373,0.01782822,0.03918811,0.0083678765,-0.031599216,0.045151804,-0.10263226,0.017998623,0.098596066,0.036193058,-0.021239808,-0.024499714,-0.0075687794,-0.11288446,-0.012903881,-0.009196812,0.075747795,0.0036196637,-4.6480118e-08,-0.047570992,-0.0013099342,-0.004753755,-0.025051724,-0.018841654,-0.056837466,0.0009153029,0.123156585,-0.0001222816,0.0138939945,0.12519929,-0.07504093,-0.09655371,0.06699432,0.09455388,0.072212756,0.04936406,0.06514172,-0.045880146,-0.038935963,0.03868831,0.05491344,-0.04791028,-0.054311443,0.08835942,-0.033394076,0.027628673,0.19141975,0.036239274,-0.0037245601,-0.00018921398,-0.0042182603,-0.0080818385,-0.034837738,0.009953185,0.066707395,0.07830892,-0.012820943,0.001397007,0.016317287,-0.11318658,0.024172993,-0.05638453,-0.009150141,0.0019831038,0.08353113,-0.032872573,0.0009421798,-0.023356628,-0.015565658,-0.016717833,-0.06640675,0.037009753,0.025857255,0.04691132,0.06642024,0.035339706,0.069856256,-0.0024838955,-0.017812716,-0.007778034,-0.0049901456,-0.040186137,0.02356897,2,18.113459,17.87493,11
158,"in today's class, sir explained vif(variance inflation factor) and pca(principal component analysis). from the plot of vif vs râ², we came to know that râ² values also came down if we mechanically tend to reduce the number of features excessively to reduce the vif, but this can lead to bad prediction model. thus there is always an trade-off between lowering of vif value and minimum râ² value you need for your model. higher vif or higher p-values suggest that the parameter/features' dependence is larger on other parameters, thus we can drop those high depending parameters. then we learned more about pcs (principal components); 1. pcs are perpendicular to each other, 2. number of pcs = number of dimensions in original dataset, 3. pc1 represents the highest variance, pc2 represents second highest variance and so on.. 
we will take number of pcs such that their cumulative variance fraction is >=0.95. then we discussed loadings of pcs and that the latter is the linear combination of variances. then we discussed interpretibility, real features (vif), non-real features (pca), and pros and cons of pca wrt to vif. 
at last, sir discussed t-sne (t-distributed stochastic neighbour encoding) which maps n-dimension distance probability (found using gaussian distribution) into 2-d or at max 3-d (now the probability if calculated using t-distribution). why t-distribution? because it can give probability of distant points in distribution as compared to gaussian distribution where probability of distant point in distribution is nearly zero. also t-distribution is helpful in another way as it further increases the distance between points when on mapped on 2-d space as compared to the distance on n-dimension.",0.033545252,-0.056061115,-0.025721403,0.019882815,0.028672049,0.05041698,-0.06945257,0.100537226,0.07342184,0.00591142,-0.017546248,0.023994386,-0.08090527,0.04490396,0.0034756204,-0.040690724,0.1367778,0.043871567,-0.08526297,0.025815664,0.035774756,-0.1093435,-0.07815347,0.0053183283,-0.014378171,0.008759341,-0.03331472,0.023285039,0.021524685,0.014294941,0.00907091,0.10510393,-0.033655766,-0.07421772,-0.003935925,0.040573888,0.026270112,0.022399466,-0.08136588,-0.024208987,0.02407167,-0.026102323,0.034763575,0.09462742,0.09519072,0.019065253,0.01766129,-0.070746,0.025012054,-0.06443426,-0.030363938,0.06287235,-0.060223438,0.005692436,-0.07077804,0.012657679,-0.031258013,-0.09180642,0.048853584,-0.016882833,-0.020327525,-0.002948983,0.055134162,-0.0040508583,0.05256401,-0.0008582275,0.003566602,-0.031782288,0.013040089,0.032098204,-0.05952944,0.057942346,-0.0692254,-0.028521555,-0.0049141436,0.03349556,0.009440649,-0.017309695,0.012161217,-0.023130512,0.093020655,0.028752616,-0.00040359463,-0.025332559,0.003132781,-0.020157758,0.032281198,-0.12629522,-0.07792272,0.0460047,0.1309242,0.05239598,0.0613348,0.006884967,0.011841086,0.06194548,0.055626642,-0.11724373,0.0040970133,0.04490278,-0.0149236005,-0.05566051,0.09310883,0.03805992,-0.025030857,-0.06979372,-0.06558483,-0.011040831,-0.0041788355,0.04160792,-0.036895674,0.040373195,-0.08741182,-0.08207657,0.086810805,0.07668728,-0.03173207,0.012659352,0.012531083,-0.0011093492,-0.031443074,-0.033019442,0.06439848,-0.022074025,0.09590757,-0.0035274937,-0.11692517,6.884224e-33,-0.012522171,0.07612617,-0.009889774,-0.019416114,-0.04526115,-0.020899294,0.017664375,-0.024054883,0.092485994,0.03705002,-0.03348215,0.019507665,0.045340728,-0.0026314254,0.048085168,-0.0032008286,-0.018903807,-0.024636848,-0.005790941,-0.008511523,0.048449475,-0.07822798,0.094031736,-0.003046604,-0.03629454,-0.09416387,-0.07737276,0.003405339,-0.09797987,-0.007992293,-0.06499369,0.0497694,0.007990978,-0.00085454097,-0.056371186,-0.08000123,-0.0060649524,-0.10545496,0.0727196,-0.06713682,0.00035328066,0.07412067,0.029974163,0.0004555472,0.039898153,0.0011880286,0.07356752,-0.031183591,-0.148042,0.049601592,-0.011832272,0.06450393,-0.050086457,0.033707745,-0.02415488,0.017530745,0.04911951,-0.07955097,-0.05188371,0.0045155464,-0.042165764,-0.016278747,0.034924954,-0.042978074,0.0076147234,-0.06155191,-0.0022017765,0.023588017,-0.0060314815,-0.0014249514,-0.024105087,-0.046197776,-0.022443013,-0.09450138,0.062489122,-0.041131634,0.010631366,0.015098724,-0.02007982,-0.014490152,-0.12397012,0.12309999,0.048051503,-0.027045652,0.024363382,-0.07757385,-0.0028036104,-0.07825314,-0.0038231676,-0.06406882,-0.018090963,0.07319686,0.048415728,-0.0009580882,0.00526313,-6.94276e-33,-0.06815956,0.071473084,-0.023307998,0.087324336,0.018889481,-0.04247898,0.00956475,-0.044322155,-0.022355253,-0.096286096,0.047873534,-0.010671936,0.002784546,-0.03568493,0.06353784,0.06601297,0.001771094,-0.039869662,0.04065836,-0.04526008,-0.0006557292,-0.009799816,-0.065094925,0.06280585,-0.03335094,-0.06132001,-0.055186763,-0.113158844,-0.03571287,-0.0007455122,-0.05160444,0.12241631,-0.056100734,0.07738229,0.020888845,-0.048774358,-0.01548572,-0.016305102,0.021628026,0.10194888,0.09209878,0.10851042,-0.0048245024,-0.017663281,-0.0571002,-0.008725423,0.07659846,0.021256221,0.09263736,-0.015631985,0.07128567,0.0024219507,0.031867173,0.046022948,0.031569637,0.0036167556,0.019792594,-0.01704692,0.09295716,0.046279773,0.054718666,-0.006782961,-0.06316881,-0.023837082,-0.0066862525,0.03060635,0.039803956,0.021413885,-0.03485828,-0.029122137,-0.050677333,-0.04044799,0.066006675,0.0072979135,-0.060777202,-0.077987894,0.022086702,0.0136795845,0.019704858,0.0064380774,-0.011323502,0.00962067,0.012666858,-0.0622592,-0.07131546,0.039710484,-0.029184205,-0.028280407,0.012969722,0.010916431,-0.039813023,0.039930608,-0.05090585,0.052112997,0.05449924,-6.131707e-08,-0.04267573,-0.031034287,-0.011825279,-0.052763604,0.026603987,-7.083836e-05,-0.02907275,0.084993176,0.009180689,0.10465801,0.07295224,-0.010681118,-0.038257655,0.030763712,0.068629704,0.13201724,0.0130855,0.030863129,-0.039666243,0.0480443,0.09692854,-0.020140002,-0.028747002,-0.06523643,0.06029113,-0.075476415,0.03294702,0.054608464,0.0056541353,0.058769584,0.026189482,0.009778328,-0.001697143,-0.0266554,-0.017924823,0.03265869,0.07208865,-0.051022887,-0.022682898,0.06462957,-0.02063778,-0.008879811,-0.044341065,-0.033888612,0.04638244,0.046279207,-0.031928685,-0.032890555,0.008652941,-0.004268013,-0.060008526,0.024565775,-0.015803268,0.05391832,0.0236328,0.029793343,-0.004142586,0.086424276,-0.03119691,-0.074404284,0.00597559,-0.040955033,-0.021717736,-0.0012743653,2,16.950758,13.678097,11
174,"started with a topic in correlation between signals. moved on to using heat maps to cluster features. mention of using varuance inflation factor to eliminate correlated variables. pca serves a similar task. caution to check with domain knowledge before using a certain result from vif.

interpretability. task of predicting and sensitivity analysis are part of interpretability. principal components do not allow for sensitivity analysis. it is recommended to use vif first and proceed with pca, if needed - when there are too many variables vif produces. normalize before pca.

208,"today's session focused on principal component analysis (pca) as a feature reduction technique, emphasizing its role in dimensionality reduction while retaining maximum variance. the discussion began with the importance of removing correlated factors using variance inflation factor (vif) before applying pca. key concepts included the identification of principal components (pcs), ensuring that they capture the highest variance in data, and how pca effectively reduces dimensionality. the session also touched on the use of the elbow method to determine the optimal number of pcs for a dataset. further, the applications of pca were explored, including its role in visualization (eda), prediction models, and understanding data structure. a comparison was made between normal regression models and pc regression, demonstrating how pca-transformed variables can enhance interpretability and model efficiency. the session concluded with a discussion on the significance of pca in real-world data analysis and its integration into predictive modeling workflows.

209,"in today's class we discussed about principal component analysis (pca). it is used as a feature reduction technique . we discussed  the importance of removing correlated factors using variance inflation factor (vif) before applying pca. the session covered how principal components (pcs) work, focusing on picking the ones that explain the most variation in the data. pca is mainly used to shrink the number of features while keeping the important information. we also looked at the elbow method, which helps decide how many pcs to keep for the best results. the session went over where pca is useful, like in data visualization (eda), predictive models, and understanding patterns in data. there was also a comparison between standard regression and pc regression, showing how transforming variables with pca can make models clearer and more efficient. we also talked about why pca is such a big deal in data analysis and how it fits into predictive modeling.",0.006682267,0.020871256,0.020392621,0.014332427,0.068774134,0.045277283,-0.016098209,0.0093042385,0.05450641,0.06495086,-0.015097112,0.1325182,-0.075774826,0.08246512,0.0017790297,-0.034074236,0.032705903,0.017232647,-0.054356724,-0.024752766,-0.012768399,-0.023199862,-0.048025712,0.029309759,0.018003467,0.05504861,0.035741437,-0.033295505,-0.038939647,-0.0032728922,0.006418193,0.086639926,0.010270896,-0.052332673,-0.08694207,0.03702331,0.042438716,0.07730358,-0.07727015,-0.012239366,0.012632722,-0.015567427,-0.024877103,0.04465959,0.15032376,0.011117952,-0.028336499,-0.100094095,0.021649169,-0.0370949,-0.04814513,-0.014817409,-0.020958547,-0.011839956,-0.07014063,-0.008081773,0.0035264106,-0.008594672,0.04597885,0.011957139,-0.025356093,-0.013348974,0.013655556,0.010004915,0.07007374,-0.046470694,0.019598432,-0.0120995315,-0.001522489,-0.011058977,-0.06968911,0.04789275,-0.034208223,0.010145369,0.03379429,0.038552336,-0.0352536,-0.017205542,0.06867654,0.005072971,0.027480692,0.12619033,-0.012031219,-0.002027362,0.02006511,0.037844677,-0.030744132,-0.089447826,-0.08340859,-0.017200148,0.08670939,0.03121606,0.0727256,-0.022960031,0.008841603,0.011405684,0.029299792,-0.092890576,0.009298877,0.03430814,0.018135687,0.007929677,0.034894146,0.0071543776,-0.056036785,-0.11590838,0.00945607,0.014122917,0.030363068,-0.005023785,-0.07074755,0.029039087,-0.09082686,-0.031756595,0.067849755,-0.030699115,-0.0006439413,0.054144684,0.032506287,0.058630865,-0.0044754813,-0.057459444,0.054532923,0.044581823,0.07716622,0.058737934,-0.083834745,5.257428e-33,0.04769416,0.011826223,-0.040224507,0.011517322,-0.00392458,-0.052692935,0.004777549,-0.03450971,0.10096525,0.07158896,-0.003908428,0.08669398,0.019527188,0.07753322,0.0324045,0.00474647,-0.05870596,0.10162036,0.004346724,-0.037147034,0.03632214,-0.051387295,0.09961419,-0.0009865636,-0.043263152,-0.01838608,-0.058109086,-0.04200191,0.0002718047,-0.010898407,-0.061588906,0.038207028,-0.064253435,0.05193828,-0.04497084,-0.075240254,0.007352533,-0.14608422,0.10022565,0.031788655,-0.026777834,0.022633787,0.030305352,-0.073561646,-0.009293951,0.06416378,0.000122776,0.004785975,-0.04683528,0.021703994,0.02304041,0.029876426,-0.00881263,0.0008559654,-0.060093675,0.060254302,0.022875505,-0.11999351,-0.022566335,-0.041286346,-0.055250235,0.061881725,-0.0036050165,-0.06743136,-0.08991671,-0.08714126,0.026638174,0.06854111,-0.033027045,-0.027971039,-0.048350897,-0.036923174,-0.049593993,-0.047461793,0.041636866,-0.038823336,-0.0405382,0.040562034,-0.0019768483,-0.0077671167,-0.061342135,0.08468431,0.02664293,-0.08049255,0.06331812,-0.039689407,0.050064016,-0.10338684,-0.0060844547,-0.09096936,-0.051418316,0.060191747,0.056978956,0.015908333,0.042182636,-4.5970653e-33,-0.06646923,0.030434668,-0.00067143486,0.07387804,0.027196968,-0.07512771,-0.00062293455,-0.06548941,0.026548475,-0.0967846,0.03673781,-0.01900421,0.027717663,0.028730152,0.07130831,0.05165033,-0.013616641,-0.03716253,-0.054804374,-0.06840934,-0.015390663,-0.0338755,0.0060946536,-0.059895713,-0.035686545,-0.08493751,-0.03361608,-0.06738769,-0.016562449,-0.046587452,-0.06302197,0.067688145,-0.04929359,0.041560017,-0.012427407,-0.00611777,-0.06116398,-0.05483031,0.005973059,0.08746246,0.07794861,0.035513025,0.023098504,-0.00044348824,-0.025640434,-0.020696612,0.023856811,0.09786653,0.044256546,0.048422813,0.04255409,0.028385375,0.03132404,-0.04089358,0.00892843,-0.013367595,0.137997,-0.04274142,0.029539322,0.010837207,0.04015343,-0.011780662,-0.0010407701,0.040997125,-0.012652582,0.0027410805,0.044861365,-0.0123196235,-0.03497016,-0.05788184,0.027460208,-0.03602092,0.012472069,0.05045843,-0.044886973,-0.045425445,0.018482221,-0.010339049,0.008027715,0.04189994,-0.004543378,-0.04126235,0.012614449,-0.08048434,-0.0056597143,0.10878985,0.036083054,-0.021244712,-0.0113625275,-0.020530352,-0.0952842,-0.02288303,-0.00459891,0.101871364,0.05429905,-5.015089e-08,-0.080608755,-0.008589791,0.004412118,-0.045374054,0.021326287,-0.076652,-0.002133643,0.15458031,0.003159851,0.038764358,0.099203594,-0.02333833,-0.082005434,0.054238055,0.10734075,0.067714214,0.067201465,0.06375138,-0.05661976,-0.052341163,0.05623406,-0.020974087,-0.029317161,-0.0340837,0.08991666,-0.06276378,0.034624025,0.17321788,0.020068036,-0.0055536223,-0.019744406,0.03085052,0.016960945,-0.029079784,0.053726964,0.055391084,0.11705183,0.0013364727,-0.0061080386,0.025900569,-0.11317203,-0.009107109,-0.041880194,0.005652724,0.036687054,0.06867999,-0.0011731719,-0.005916985,-0.025331244,0.015419023,-0.02976055,-0.03680177,0.03598363,0.025146713,0.049066618,0.08157978,0.04528359,0.025901517,-0.012541823,-0.029478036,-0.042989172,0.014910672,-0.015185181,0.0035222792,2,18.547384,17.680832,11
227,"today in class, proff started by discussing about heatmaps which is used to help visualize relationships between multiple parameters. then we discussed about variance inflation factor(vif) which is used to detect multicollinearity. the higher value of vif for a particular feature suggest that it should be removed from the model in order to improve the model's performance. then we discussed about pca ( principal component analysis) is based on singular value decomposition of matrix and transforms correlated features into orthogonal principal components. pca can reduce dimensionality visualisation and prediction but does not take sensitivity into account which makes normalisation neccessary.",0.05867957,-0.068597935,-0.050443295,-0.006064517,0.06716716,0.015608066,-0.04181062,-0.06463682,0.027716875,0.04594835,0.02247881,0.009660064,-0.08008292,0.07810348,-0.061115794,-0.027214285,0.019259939,0.05983646,-0.06929523,-0.038623277,0.0120283235,-0.017497664,-0.10358306,-0.02604779,0.013244517,0.057186622,0.026249878,0.024584807,-0.03540015,0.034736495,-0.009410551,0.08195752,-0.036698025,-0.042940646,-0.0035037426,0.024523139,0.044280957,0.0844529,-0.10737993,0.031962335,0.013234418,0.0020449616,0.016188355,0.018196465,0.12600453,-0.005706414,-0.080155954,-0.07912878,0.0685434,-0.04021366,-0.053509165,-0.028971838,-0.08941684,0.012875788,-0.033969905,0.00063721504,-0.0012827651,-0.10414696,0.02750009,-0.012477061,-0.05342805,0.04653799,-0.008556046,-0.0073998454,0.14730658,-0.015280092,-0.028905569,-0.031057633,-0.014560959,0.0053168586,-0.08099465,0.018625807,0.0033823983,-0.079555795,0.010666897,0.08053889,-0.095341176,-0.0449864,0.088541895,-0.047250737,0.060040385,0.07899204,9.45501e-05,-0.053120337,0.027594427,0.007676026,0.01526418,-0.096308276,0.0104896445,0.019948646,0.08892023,0.06816578,0.008220715,-0.022701012,-0.0608321,0.014125445,0.035599586,-0.0623903,0.02977953,0.006931791,0.00021670552,-0.09514531,0.071621664,0.07475876,-0.036269084,-0.05323174,0.048482493,0.027448915,0.011713191,-0.039501913,-0.062197104,0.006921591,-0.08745828,-0.038337704,0.034190014,-0.008767729,0.019956756,0.022198537,0.06699054,0.02351141,-0.050668824,-0.030836884,0.07618639,0.059020113,0.05904644,0.022087662,-0.059141133,7.043199e-33,0.036995735,0.04794316,0.01671146,-0.007864686,-0.052532237,-0.0127396,0.0025599897,-0.070308685,0.10346323,0.019415554,0.03055716,0.09454365,-0.020987397,0.08371743,-0.039254766,-0.02381795,0.044879075,0.054448523,-0.020736372,-0.04184981,0.045032162,0.016361305,0.06466956,-0.046100754,-0.023589076,-0.017639294,-0.061697304,0.005328809,-0.0564159,0.022898562,-0.016887935,0.05840962,-0.08680113,0.011057213,-0.09571767,-0.019699587,-0.008513589,-0.07231575,0.101419516,-0.026777335,-0.022853984,-0.028677654,0.047508445,-0.036380373,-0.04911961,0.09029948,0.061699476,0.021818684,-0.052952375,-0.022520652,0.00091161963,-0.008263719,-0.015572672,0.0036040272,-0.015939763,0.06469631,0.04573969,-0.089703485,0.0010686533,-0.042403072,-0.121725485,0.047280665,-0.049742945,-0.083742045,-0.06816359,-0.064641945,-0.013238491,0.014401123,0.029354474,0.025875822,-0.04262208,-0.014348902,0.004950714,-0.04978529,0.0029905357,-0.00965765,-0.014644994,0.061150126,-0.03297557,0.0020584299,-0.08289888,0.04971251,0.035184998,-0.06136772,-0.004104647,-0.062939234,0.0057759695,-0.05251592,-0.028913898,-0.10013185,-0.010115364,0.074755475,0.059775017,0.024964932,0.016274529,-7.7813744e-33,-0.05775964,0.021864772,-0.010984256,0.105717145,0.036475237,-0.086685844,-0.052515402,-0.04197482,-0.013347023,-0.072580025,0.09135316,-0.08504499,-0.040947024,-0.036825404,0.10166972,0.06784859,-0.008386803,0.0052628405,-0.0053853183,-0.041237444,-0.04199019,-0.023854332,-0.037430122,-0.016449282,-0.06351881,-0.06348073,-0.0032773789,-0.12247881,-0.0791411,0.03024383,-0.07098863,0.07018603,-0.021065675,0.06040859,0.007104027,-0.023837294,-0.041760568,-0.055959415,0.011168634,0.062924996,0.018639931,0.07505865,0.020543411,0.00040997355,-0.0057045245,-0.02059345,0.07278427,0.0072241453,0.08323661,0.026075367,0.01611343,-0.0103782285,0.051338878,-0.030727917,-0.040546253,0.040208373,0.080649175,-0.031904463,0.07615525,0.009089179,0.05633125,-0.021038601,-0.03966976,-0.0066651027,0.054018028,0.013640984,0.024442049,-0.054037448,0.040628806,-0.014124669,0.07999169,-0.017003084,-0.020353576,0.012852781,-0.05198971,-0.103127725,0.03945313,0.02089539,-0.014682352,0.055963986,0.054021213,-0.013569402,0.0590909,-0.02481919,-0.040476628,0.07105444,0.06324305,-0.05332339,-0.011870779,-0.03031655,0.007271251,-0.00940342,-0.040496502,0.095594294,0.030333735,-5.2067254e-08,-0.115452155,0.0044696657,-0.015732767,-0.08175542,0.008422123,-0.07724399,0.053727303,0.08814281,0.056106746,0.058753517,0.08477121,-0.04451323,-0.06497598,0.00750003,0.08300372,0.03871697,0.020402733,0.046993606,-0.026950756,-0.003520146,0.07563282,0.022902492,-0.026214259,0.006264279,0.03393365,-6.822646e-05,0.04050565,0.13466044,0.08112902,0.054172475,-0.018059243,0.020467002,0.028096521,-0.036782578,0.025205383,0.08432826,0.0847332,-0.0354894,-0.06993934,0.07149539,-0.053479396,0.05803952,-0.05162031,-0.02172393,0.05797129,0.07600005,0.02437969,-0.05783753,-0.01621941,0.059532385,-0.016428985,0.023892403,-0.012764727,0.06493743,0.027884625,-0.048889156,0.009655441,0.05670605,-0.0037383446,-0.01860955,0.005973349,-0.04804946,-0.02055196,-0.014282029,2,16.976309,17.044916,11
237,"today's lecture began with variance inflation factor (vif), where we explored how vif varies with râ² and examined its graphical representation. we learned that the factor with the highest vif is the most dependent, so we remove it iteratively until all remaining factors have a vif below the threshold.

next, we covered principal component analysis (pca), another feature reduction method. key observations included:

the number of principal components equals the original data dimensions, but we select the most important ones.
principal components are orthogonal to each other.
the principal axis that captures the most variance in the data is considered the most significant.
each principal component has loadings with the original features.
we then discussed the use cases of pca, including:

prediction models â€“ pca can be used for improving model performance but is not suitable for ""what-if"" scenarios, where retaining actual features is crucial.
exploratory data analysis (eda) â€“ understanding data structure and reducing dimensions for visualization.
to illustrate pca, we applied it to a 28ã—28 pixel dataset used for predicting handwritten numbers.

finally, we introduced t-sne (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) and compared normal distribution vs. t-distribution",-0.004675191,-0.06343063,0.029958092,0.015964953,0.05972911,0.029526979,-0.082593985,0.0060432577,0.019578667,-0.041398574,-0.027226213,0.0704053,-0.012174684,0.079464756,-0.06118252,-0.012085379,0.10107175,0.06556507,-0.07664099,-0.032209564,-0.012185455,-0.056314632,-0.050741266,-0.021455998,0.07060895,0.021231838,0.042036694,-0.057726376,2.5743993e-05,0.024099035,0.02540412,0.06570746,-0.024108524,-0.06603533,-0.087750725,0.04110576,0.011468492,0.07137775,-0.08457459,-0.006340859,0.009024643,0.0020947233,0.00080137677,0.05077627,0.10375286,0.011466234,-0.008278241,-0.091933794,0.016569747,0.012720263,-0.008796693,0.006708529,-0.078972645,0.032627396,-0.04384381,-0.027020521,0.026903342,-0.066708006,0.044075433,0.0015225781,0.0101753995,-0.019595757,0.0033233105,-0.0038253875,0.038195465,-0.031299315,0.04017309,-0.00705042,-0.017839415,0.014541191,-0.025764583,0.073770896,-0.031229392,0.027982539,-0.008978902,0.07348888,0.026698474,-0.012055677,0.10855221,-0.039187953,0.056106366,0.070866846,-0.013307466,-0.0217682,0.03628673,-0.008374675,0.040587675,-0.01780518,-0.050720956,0.034723602,0.03131543,0.062465545,0.033936128,-0.044291947,-0.009478714,0.0040860646,0.060297724,-0.10431988,-0.019703323,0.07909406,0.009288288,0.018304193,0.0672621,0.007824838,-0.00202787,-0.08977198,0.02688488,-0.01435722,0.020033162,-0.06391092,0.002613823,0.0022515804,-0.09497714,-0.023675898,0.11549017,-0.024091404,0.04682315,0.0364776,0.0067757796,0.0408515,-0.042831138,0.018689271,0.029602176,0.021529904,0.11630492,0.015717097,-0.07869558,7.053118e-33,0.08890519,0.037733767,0.008602962,0.0010771989,0.03298922,-0.02933901,-0.0042204475,-0.011884384,0.04364899,0.070924796,-0.052702527,0.047223184,-0.019210175,0.07329161,0.043700658,-0.008168586,-0.013439918,0.02415043,-0.017500939,-0.039623294,0.058923807,-0.07430549,0.069961905,0.004926379,-0.06475253,-0.083895385,-0.018162878,-0.066814914,-0.027496872,0.0062933313,-0.11191571,0.013609475,-0.030032806,0.027760748,-0.0507127,-0.12005953,-0.030040884,-0.09186757,0.0965762,-0.025031721,0.017081182,0.022067735,0.0034078446,-0.056290142,-0.06248339,0.023855738,0.0626279,-0.06114018,-0.027234232,0.006615179,0.053257324,0.008402421,-0.0073333117,-0.0141434865,-0.048507016,0.004808334,0.060971376,-0.048804615,0.038366918,-0.019923504,-0.074301824,0.026885668,-0.035177767,0.023858735,-0.026947692,-0.056792084,-0.0045165606,0.07391853,-0.0667043,-0.020657,-0.047872122,-0.009783716,0.004823616,-0.070881695,0.022792691,-0.021189503,0.014180261,-0.02948623,-0.042247053,0.007769763,-0.11004447,0.023887493,0.0114174355,-0.09579714,0.016965156,-0.08067219,0.03929112,-0.13361095,0.011880922,-0.10213951,-0.039114423,0.025947466,0.08192091,-0.025957732,0.019454941,-5.5776263e-33,-0.09877546,0.054672748,0.009089481,0.08458105,0.0391228,-0.049292024,-0.029649487,0.012104619,-0.02670982,-0.11778116,0.036807455,-0.03738881,0.038450096,-0.00096038554,0.06441158,0.05333739,0.0003713892,0.00075888,-0.055096906,-0.06153605,-0.064203605,-0.04444976,-0.026302168,0.036089014,-0.040384352,-0.017661005,0.01950812,-0.07714516,-0.029312255,-0.06924836,-0.042530756,0.060783453,-0.029401293,0.052160818,-0.032536775,-0.0036550548,0.0039720666,-0.07920497,0.003172786,0.09680093,0.13588502,0.046413668,0.010935752,0.05173393,-0.05304517,-0.023451475,-0.013225235,0.07211071,0.079019286,0.023562437,0.026398556,0.058199603,0.0042527816,0.015235771,0.032461286,-0.014040125,0.082285024,-0.034037855,0.10399663,0.036734696,0.014168747,-0.059515852,-0.01503743,-0.02588123,-0.024077177,-0.051453866,0.02690724,0.041326612,-0.032530744,0.00649593,-0.0050316933,-0.007623193,-0.046309676,-0.017557714,-0.010803388,-0.049218908,0.05944077,0.013161022,0.026046121,-0.004406023,0.044620417,-0.010369424,0.03141318,-0.073436506,0.031313818,0.1470837,0.020466764,-0.014736695,0.038068365,0.0055972673,-0.06479989,0.05497012,-0.052256085,0.10421985,0.07752835,-5.5127828e-08,-0.07018085,0.017143197,0.010628602,-0.04752033,0.02471375,-0.069995865,0.051012244,0.15005709,0.02389667,0.019414742,0.1359,-0.06282149,-0.10349103,-0.011476133,0.061622266,0.11013875,0.045263994,-0.0040062526,-0.024100458,-0.009428512,0.042331293,-0.0067277616,0.0060396725,-0.0156133,0.0463556,-0.055401,0.014007451,0.18021335,0.07899349,-0.0077613266,-0.0004976014,-0.002940729,0.00900375,-0.069212474,-0.005926914,0.024118178,0.12896964,-0.021823958,-0.018961977,0.041996904,-0.000117531294,0.06152242,-0.03561801,-0.0070635653,0.005232541,0.067329116,0.01938099,-0.046179462,0.018143667,0.00473095,-0.07712804,-0.042205144,0.017330948,0.07770703,0.0633454,0.037112124,-0.022770192,0.032667406,0.028431503,-0.047296505,-0.022244025,-0.046244,-0.07743462,0.008029037,2,15.809214,15.9443865,11
239,"learned about pca, which helps reduce data size while keeping important patterns.
before using pca, it's necessary to remove similar information using vif.
principal components (pcs) were introduced, which hold the most important variations in the data.
pca helps in simplifying data by keeping only the essential parts.
the elbow method was explained as a way to decide how many pcs to keep.

256,"in todayâ€™s lecture we saw some more methods to reduce the dimensionality of data, inorder to solve data problems associated with large dimensions. 
in the last class, we had talked about vif analysis. we continued the discussion on it. 
in vif analysis, we start eliminating the features one by one, with the ones having large vif values. we continue the process until we get a set of features which have vif values, smaller than the desired threshold, which can be 10/5. we eliminate the features based on our domain knowledge.
depending on the threshold set, we can have different combination and numbers of features selected for the regression model. in such a case, we should evaluate the metrics for each of the model and then by comparing these, we can decide which one to use.
the next method we saw was that of pca (principal component analysis). it helps to reduce the dimensionality of the problem by creating orthogonal principal components. each of the principal component is a combination of the original features, with the weights called as â€˜loadingsâ€™. the loadings tell us the importance of each feature. so, instead of using too many features, we are combining them into a principal component and using this to predict the response variable. the number of principal components is equal to that of the original dimensions. however, we can decide to take up two/three of these pcs suitable to our model. the first pc explains the maximum variance in the data, the next explains some amount of the remaining variance. this continues until all the principal components explain the complete variance in the data.
the cumulative variance explained by all the pcs is given by the elbow diagram, which is asymptotic to 1. the elbow diagram tells us how many pcs would be needed to explain a certain amount of variance in the data.
among the two methods, vif is generally preferred first because of interpretability. x1,x2,x3 etc.  represent the actual physical features, whereas the pcs, which are a combination of these are just mathematical parameters. 
so, pcs are most suitable for prediction analysis but they cannot be used for â€˜what-if analysisâ€™ or â€˜delta analysisâ€™. hence, through pcs we achieve the goal of reducing the dimensions, however we cannot do any sensitivity analysis.
so, normally vif is done first and if still there are many features left, we perform pca.
the advantages of using pca is that it helps in dimension reduction (data reduction), predictive analysis, visualization (understanding of the structure of the data). so, this is a part of eda and can be used to determine the number of clusters (k) in k-means clustering.
another disadvantage of pca is that it is sensitive to data scale. hence, normalization (if required) must be done before doing pca.
next, we talked about the t-sne plots. 
the t-sne plots also reduce the large number of dimensions in the data into 2-3 dimensions which can be easily visualized. this is done on the basis of the distance between the points in the n-dimensional space. through this method, we lose the exactness of the data, but instead we get the information about the relative closeness of the points. 
t-sne creates a probability distribution for each of the point, which contains the probability of closeness of that point from every other point. 
gaussian normal distribution is used in higher dimensional space, but in t-sne, as the name suggests, t-distribution is used. t-distribution increases the distance between dissimilar points. so, in n-dimensional space, if the probability of two points being close is very high, they are clustered together in the t-sne plots.
all these methods help in reducing the number of dimensions in the data set.

we started the lecture with discussion on vif and understood the justification about the threshold values and its use on identifying the independent features.
next, we started principal component analysis (pca), which helps to reduce the dimensions of data to help get the understanding the maximum variance, where pc1 gives max variance, pc2 has next maximum and moving on which we understood with an example 2-d linear dataset. reduced to 1d aligning the axis to the line. each principal component is the linear combination of the original features which are known as loaders. vif should be conducted first to eliminate multi-collinearity and pca since affects interpretability as features are the combination of multiple features. 
next we used t-sne helping to visualize data in 2d, based on t-distribution using gradient descent algorithm making it slow and inconsistent. it calculates probability distribution for all points which are the nearest neighbors for each and every point. it can be very sueful tool for classification and clustering",-0.0049053235,-0.05391727,0.014779029,-0.074034646,0.03000099,0.0122432485,-0.061413508,-0.0018651908,0.012561908,-0.017798599,-0.019998195,0.033362955,-0.061500255,0.06389032,-0.04441077,-0.0011870039,0.113424666,0.052734453,-0.030564366,-0.020304585,0.019610176,-0.008589852,-0.022908613,0.034850653,0.021282602,0.031981494,0.0026762267,-0.026824627,-0.02380657,0.015727077,-0.016465433,0.041540857,-0.032541983,-0.0077134697,-0.0693354,0.0247571,-0.0013032522,0.07968462,-0.08843372,0.005468923,-0.04045429,9.9388126e-05,-0.022171509,0.0169134,0.082717314,0.030996144,-0.015241269,-0.11134545,0.04761304,-0.02496111,-0.02932265,-0.0018861283,-0.069655046,0.035371535,-0.05895175,-0.023367114,0.08216362,-0.08342253,0.047613394,-0.007321117,0.026383776,-0.017463293,0.084229425,0.043949258,0.10398519,-0.022101078,-0.0067672464,0.023859605,-0.005624368,-0.035624214,-0.07839393,0.02290143,-0.022454713,0.011524159,-0.024028337,0.07760633,-0.020752015,0.016821029,0.060776673,-0.07345646,0.043474685,0.086434454,0.048170447,-0.009111767,0.025416955,-0.007504946,-0.013892,-0.07163134,-0.046229087,0.05928487,0.060073555,0.08888502,0.032889087,0.018004376,-0.025831621,-0.059255186,0.012634966,-0.16056103,0.031349793,0.066744864,-0.05173,-0.06414087,0.08078602,-0.014518617,-0.0031106884,-0.06988287,0.01225343,-0.01876009,0.057053015,-0.08365804,0.006619787,0.029520506,-0.07772309,-0.06601769,0.058825303,0.0016283337,0.010770995,0.11210236,0.06784526,0.022598423,-0.067378625,-0.09451507,-0.02494426,-0.001291871,0.10629698,0.044102456,-0.0479002,6.1638655e-33,0.052722525,0.0052282275,-0.0027754887,0.035499852,-0.010008156,-0.016734743,0.036694087,-0.058010865,0.013960549,0.07598182,-0.0450475,-0.055699766,0.016431373,0.10309143,0.040621318,-0.026394235,0.0071160677,-0.014528511,-0.0008819695,-0.046674736,0.040030085,-0.06732162,0.09890779,-0.039051637,-0.06487104,-0.057776436,-0.04588334,-0.049576703,-0.02897297,-0.00034069232,-0.085172035,0.043585394,-0.02630342,-0.009742065,-0.022163728,-0.06989853,0.01112057,-0.05489058,0.069767185,-0.028693339,0.03493319,0.021265836,0.058762006,-0.1028671,-0.041572955,0.08561589,0.03778167,0.017055782,-0.044096787,-0.003012398,-0.037356745,-0.029470693,-0.036111712,-0.0022203873,-0.038385175,0.061717775,0.0031655072,-0.063740924,-0.00157856,0.033156965,-0.03769091,0.019153973,0.015410587,-0.020668006,0.014728764,-0.076342046,-0.026754707,0.038787268,-0.012133751,0.021174798,-0.039996143,0.024236195,0.03585973,-0.11379098,0.050917733,-0.026076129,-0.0070610014,0.020560883,0.028031623,0.025068838,-0.121492736,0.015940187,0.038544208,-0.04525356,-0.004743035,-0.031168854,0.024081463,-0.11267348,-0.045062564,-0.03827491,-0.039370544,0.053291664,0.08052792,0.030051708,0.005157495,-5.1538158e-33,-0.0738219,0.117857434,-0.009485428,0.0403989,0.041881323,-0.01722178,-0.09366514,-0.0164086,-0.037294243,-0.010635299,0.01768066,-0.040479254,0.0001709122,-0.06812381,0.032666378,0.03825018,-0.0012000022,-0.02723294,-0.02962529,-0.020559778,0.04938442,-0.0052755745,-0.06842833,0.014336153,-0.013525507,-0.016151413,-0.008689308,-0.028029177,-0.07220421,0.0021095856,-0.05978535,0.06849451,-0.023348004,0.09443739,-0.012679094,0.0108953975,-0.0012045002,-0.092167415,0.026764082,0.079484984,0.08183889,0.05667523,-0.022008842,-0.00124813,-0.039698474,-0.03525172,0.03756771,0.1088629,-0.017917385,0.01300098,0.008117988,0.06570867,0.0055590426,0.061453972,0.054752428,0.014460518,0.06703627,-0.025781307,0.058496397,0.014051741,0.026765263,0.006584971,-0.0673979,0.037482593,0.021390494,-0.006041258,0.031496122,0.030382516,0.0054683094,0.011231873,0.024357326,0.03335812,0.052021783,-0.0885258,-0.016456058,-0.12010791,0.017173883,-0.03460584,-0.004702213,0.0032041376,0.060408745,-0.039732233,0.0464442,0.039657388,0.016874239,0.12171384,0.05514641,-0.05655026,0.10436283,0.011112896,-0.027277654,0.051177386,-0.048878543,0.08485979,0.056571085,-6.259014e-08,-0.072457165,-0.048418384,-0.059463877,-0.097277105,0.06975571,-0.05259263,0.02360715,0.20113616,-0.045469284,0.038528882,0.09249182,-0.022154426,-0.07789729,0.0037982548,0.07076026,0.09344836,0.014067104,0.087251306,-0.039262664,0.062617235,0.03659533,-0.070142195,0.0035701976,-0.04045382,0.028870957,-0.0641993,0.018754413,0.06066145,0.113550246,-0.009848431,-0.036419205,-0.028220605,-0.011457984,-0.041598685,0.048834197,0.076840624,-0.026284022,-0.01612931,-0.043980613,0.094609104,-0.04434592,0.057991263,0.023694267,0.016584333,0.055779677,0.068697214,-0.0117205,-0.0076420284,0.034797948,-0.017828664,-0.062912494,0.016085213,-0.0035150205,0.09773652,0.009180477,0.042258866,-0.017128589,0.056983333,5.2303203e-05,-0.036135256,0.020079391,-0.04354253,-0.07419117,-0.0724984,2,19.110731,13.720072,11
279,"we started with vif, variance inflation factor( effect of all the axes {except xi} on xi). if greater vif-> r^2 is close to 1.{heavy dependence of xi on rest of them} no problem if we eliminate that feature. progressively, keep on eliminating features one by one {on the basis of higher vif for feature reduction}.

pca-> the max number of pc's are equal to the number of dimensions of the dataset. whenever we do pca, always pc1 is something which explains the maximum variation in the data. pc2 explans the 2nd max amount of variation in the data. pc helps you reduce the dimensionality of the problem. each pc can be linearly dependent on all of the real dimensions.

so what should we do first pca or vif?
vif, because it reduces the real dimension which could have been incorporated in the pca without eliminating them. later after real dimension elimination we get the real picture and the pca would be so beneficial to us for dimension reduction.

it helps us in data reduction, prediction model, visualization (part of eda{exploratory data analysis})

t-sne (t-distributed stochastic neighbour encoding) for each point it calculates the probability distribution of distance of all other points wrt that point.

at higher dimension --> gaussian normal distribution

298,"we looked at principal component analysis (pca) and variance inflation factor (vif), how they differ and their functions of telling us about the correlation between features, eliminating redundant variables to increase the computation efficiency, and reduce itâ€™s cost. we also looked at t-sne (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) and how it works. we studied this through

375,in today's class we mainly discussed vif and pca. vif stands for variance inflation factor which is used to see if there is any relation between the features or not. higher value of vif suggests a high co-relation. then we also discussed a plot between r squared and vif where we saw elbows at 5 and 10. then we discussed pca  which stands for principle component analysis where we choose an axis where the variance is maximum of the features. then the other axis has some less variance and this goes on. single value decomposition is used while performing principle component analysis.,0.031174313,-0.007870491,-0.0627732,-0.06277238,0.021034848,0.012689659,-0.039248385,0.034040004,0.0586763,0.043332957,0.020239774,0.05695877,-0.048574395,0.05549519,-0.008975833,-0.027110437,0.059198484,0.030257832,-0.059517093,-0.00935162,-0.019385725,-0.009650147,-0.083743565,0.017433362,0.026441041,0.05165888,-0.02747516,0.013071332,0.07773732,0.04280807,0.010830273,0.11586755,0.0032448615,-0.05149426,-0.08257297,0.06383153,0.06717715,0.024063544,-0.08432155,0.036333486,-0.032901872,0.03601643,0.008270467,0.03625908,0.109427914,0.08191755,-0.06990514,-0.114109084,0.011149443,-0.021199584,-0.06742039,0.01556497,-0.111180454,0.04801951,0.0004036268,-0.00917568,-0.00825643,-0.08357884,0.024378557,-0.009748711,-0.013169029,0.024878608,0.035965227,0.0359504,0.100668654,-0.03542356,-0.026394852,-0.025366368,-0.039627142,-0.006180941,-0.082675755,-0.015820168,-0.061390612,0.003228468,-0.048994806,0.060468003,-0.045478143,-0.07436695,0.053458005,-0.019288702,0.036420908,0.10296767,-0.025782324,-0.014770315,-0.00039487428,0.012336065,-0.003358675,-0.079045564,-0.038046777,0.028652845,0.06293062,0.054481063,0.076163985,-0.009822218,0.003148564,0.010020129,0.04510342,-0.07779921,0.040718876,0.033199877,-0.007970905,-0.084485486,0.040852264,0.066295765,-0.04167494,-0.0728779,-0.018472997,-0.019337952,0.05158379,-0.020360896,-0.107160285,0.010677767,-0.091577925,-0.06970916,0.04648637,-0.040067073,0.017825997,0.07481752,0.06523599,-0.0016220929,-0.013059936,-0.08737886,0.030538153,0.006286777,0.04645881,0.024281304,-0.05145719,2.6813136e-33,0.020704627,0.007870966,0.0048924126,0.008375693,-0.055863988,-0.020590192,0.009155267,-0.071923785,0.11266714,0.09017623,0.009530844,0.055656664,0.026290601,0.040724188,0.013110837,-0.035894472,-0.020026146,0.03225352,-0.00993522,-0.07310872,0.07295224,0.0078310985,0.1286314,0.027745571,0.0026061223,-0.071632594,-0.05037045,-0.039609537,-0.09521608,-0.005493455,-0.030960128,0.07115202,-0.033208717,0.025813174,-0.07475845,-0.08772558,-0.009087144,-0.100922234,0.08004225,-0.018446766,0.002950382,-0.0020401836,-0.0022224486,-0.07524071,0.014691353,0.03332053,0.025519477,0.016546957,-0.0066009257,0.0011371064,-0.048449162,0.03152258,0.028969467,-0.020726753,0.0033357781,0.06505749,0.055584043,-0.03417297,-0.09546585,-0.027461546,-0.08673151,0.083999716,-0.0098352665,-0.08522047,-0.048348326,-0.030962983,-0.012804479,-0.03352349,0.016936623,-0.0179419,-0.022360755,0.0255049,-0.041843217,-0.05842234,-0.012974796,-0.04801321,-0.052905727,0.024184294,-0.017311295,-0.028474437,-0.16649882,0.08767672,0.029132443,-0.073525764,-0.009341565,-0.027519654,-0.0016392561,-0.052237455,-0.011754797,-0.10146873,-0.03632437,0.032439385,0.094958626,-0.016389262,0.05187439,-4.5981085e-33,-0.087642446,0.044546787,-0.06486735,0.09798885,0.05675507,-0.06574384,-0.027975887,-0.070118226,0.029168274,0.0011931448,0.021164507,-0.009647755,-0.021287179,-0.03309324,0.03680618,0.04995895,-0.02430697,-0.055237122,-0.031173829,-0.04725542,-0.00092811184,-0.054485098,0.00406602,-0.018655578,0.02617766,-0.047565363,-0.017238257,-0.13149677,-0.03241352,-0.018152487,-0.053593278,0.04878378,0.014692936,0.08241128,0.009561772,-0.0478727,-0.008323855,-0.11169596,0.013242519,0.045083262,0.03751628,0.07218769,0.0982849,0.041407123,-0.04779278,-0.021262841,0.012914368,0.069477916,0.04202978,-0.04796848,0.04842067,0.025769955,0.047002234,0.007898746,0.011766779,0.011759553,0.060870163,-0.0066656624,0.048914094,0.035305116,0.109967984,-0.01618372,-0.048885953,0.073964216,-0.009129109,0.060168333,0.041696947,-0.023045825,-0.017207054,-0.050265715,0.06817921,0.019960048,0.023859853,-0.0007366678,-0.060952738,-0.09050196,0.030293437,0.013562771,0.037773266,0.0346984,0.010748,-0.008803389,0.034826584,-0.027276667,-0.06678594,0.050400976,-0.033719476,-0.033030502,0.02878947,-0.015590987,-0.045683578,-0.014356325,-0.0389952,0.04114554,0.071586266,-4.8247117e-08,-0.043137327,-0.07318046,-0.018235,-0.08807966,0.041275416,-0.04747423,0.0150441155,0.045950234,0.023487957,0.08364899,0.08582433,-0.023775995,-0.06683725,0.011592064,0.0660319,0.020499034,0.030418286,0.08417453,-0.036444906,0.057923645,0.09740647,-0.01191487,-0.01307775,-0.05402159,0.05170269,-0.05562983,0.012614536,0.12563829,0.0649344,0.02984114,-0.012587741,0.009970629,0.012908027,-0.06489819,0.0348149,0.09739628,0.07946539,-0.0031673857,-0.072516754,0.065167055,-0.078853376,-0.007259371,-0.026863733,-0.017660739,0.042882465,0.14557256,-0.015677825,0.0075690467,-0.012949727,-0.018267062,-0.07710602,0.020794602,-0.02116847,0.026737284,-0.012007353,0.021042172,0.016501665,0.030785855,0.029716851,-0.098272614,0.022686152,-0.0029937855,0.008808915,-0.026918504,2,18.479755,16.231646,11
383,"variance inflation factor (vif)
purpose: detects and addresses multicollinearity among independent features.
process: involves an iterative approach to select independent features by evaluating their correlation.
key consideration: itâ€™s crucial to justify the chosen threshold for vif, as it determines the level of multicollinearity deemed acceptable.
principal component analysis (pca)
core idea: reduces dimensionality by transforming data into new axes (principal components) that capture the maximum variance.
principal components: components like pc1, pc2, etc., are ranked by the amount of variance they explain.
loadings: represent the contribution of original features to each principal component.
preprocessing: data normalization is essential before applying pca to ensure accurate results.
trade-off: while pca reduces dimensions, it often sacrifices interpretability of the original features.
visualization: pc1 vs. pc2 plots are commonly used to visualize high-dimensional data in a 2d space.
role in eda: pca is a valuable tool in exploratory data analysis for uncovering patterns and simplifying data.
comparison of vif and pca
order of application: vif should be used first to remove multicollinearity among features.
pcaâ€™s role: while pca effectively reduces dimensions, it can obscure the interpretability of the original variables.
t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-sne)
purpose: a visualization technique for projecting high-dimensional data into two or three dimensions.
methodology: utilizes t-distribution and gradient descent to map data points while preserving local relationships.
limitations: computationally intensive, non-deterministic (results may vary), and less consistent compared to other methods.
mechanism: constructs a probability distribution to represent the proximity of points in high-dimensional space, then reduces dimensions while maintaining these relationships.
applications: particularly useful for classification and clustering tasks, as it emphasizes differences between data points.",0.03152437,-0.07172075,0.0028083415,-0.030974207,0.049308404,0.01323845,-0.068600774,-0.018705828,0.02871703,-0.0032412743,0.012214576,0.01043199,-0.12332824,0.055659566,-0.027847549,-0.0022462746,0.096788466,0.019243572,-0.09674063,-0.04065696,0.059361406,-0.04836087,-0.06117782,0.0056600953,-0.0028164745,0.07105203,-0.026259867,0.031482264,-0.024780575,0.02837008,-0.00084651576,0.07902968,0.00090165023,-0.030849982,-0.030381732,0.034425847,0.041865613,0.037894685,-0.07684598,-0.0037929462,-0.016927049,0.012714119,-0.0028682998,0.038380243,0.11739912,0.0015414956,-0.059380494,-0.080503576,0.053600494,-0.008746959,-0.0089505,-0.024354562,-0.08205138,0.021621313,-0.02758176,0.03467602,0.0058933725,-0.100672044,0.06617814,-0.033873588,-0.051924895,0.019861095,0.031368736,0.027790878,0.093663804,-0.043685764,0.0111240065,-0.057873663,-0.03376735,0.01617589,-0.07368414,0.024696019,-0.01373329,0.015913999,-0.015987882,0.097535364,-0.08448298,-0.036252826,0.04576827,-0.061071374,0.0785068,0.12652536,-0.0052715125,0.0039553107,0.028876696,0.00701661,0.012392839,-0.0870573,-0.05398395,0.04782171,0.077753305,0.09372105,0.043456994,0.0048423903,-0.011432574,-0.01211173,0.02557857,-0.08801991,0.034125213,0.02405835,0.011605728,-0.077874556,0.049910698,0.057415035,-0.03250371,-0.07403197,-0.0011761395,0.020262081,0.03495432,0.0010395829,-0.05299567,0.007867721,-0.045656227,0.0012998948,0.073301144,0.045889612,-0.008033395,0.057367373,0.043579694,0.021430524,0.020899665,-0.06179277,0.06692732,0.016451288,0.056828074,0.049569488,-0.036869027,6.507682e-33,0.045787003,0.030014966,0.02912864,0.03277935,-0.047551733,-0.025751268,-0.008367803,-0.044179942,0.0466463,0.09421774,-0.008946707,0.06605012,-0.01714838,0.060613632,-0.024754446,-0.023887513,0.05274432,0.03824557,-0.024759669,-0.02199519,0.042245552,-0.06058567,0.0744494,-0.035717968,-0.03383354,-0.09754027,-0.099095725,-0.036530744,-0.05187483,0.0009994294,-0.061191175,0.020405099,-0.01709029,-0.011907935,-0.0867178,-0.084055595,0.029592164,-0.10957471,0.13094011,0.027326366,0.015191313,0.016989961,0.039627757,-0.07647827,-0.039129205,0.053872485,0.037774775,-0.027187543,-0.02901475,0.0021812043,0.017157985,0.017223146,0.011455316,-0.007990495,-0.04677817,0.06355717,0.061583117,-0.09392463,0.016364537,-0.03437525,-0.10656727,0.016168991,-0.034114808,-0.008522051,-0.043991674,-0.09517439,0.0041722106,0.03836319,-0.047218237,0.044578653,-0.048308548,0.004064999,0.0051489263,-0.053703025,0.021960925,-0.032863233,-0.055400703,0.047743186,-0.029380014,-0.02675841,-0.086551614,0.07439329,0.03191863,-0.05236561,0.007868521,-0.06413056,0.0062193247,-0.077721626,-0.05418442,-0.10388924,0.0043065893,0.058325034,0.101587385,-0.02975869,0.023962827,-6.989972e-33,-0.053463034,0.058592234,-0.00825333,0.06290205,0.062157433,0.0009257137,-0.044180628,-0.070543446,0.025264528,-0.088248394,0.063902594,-0.016466444,-0.012023842,-0.053149313,0.11030082,0.06934228,-0.021392483,0.0053635743,-0.016967481,-0.054219585,0.011455057,-0.10751429,-0.028371293,-0.024424393,0.0061282283,-0.04850352,-0.021957006,-0.119024485,-0.03426292,-0.005064955,-0.05172439,0.086521454,-0.012206635,0.07130749,0.02364261,-0.030046433,0.005800632,-0.14699864,-0.0076374756,0.07339939,0.046361204,0.09796072,0.021947203,0.016910685,-0.040384777,-0.020572571,0.071264625,0.052671663,0.06251394,0.033156168,0.014204387,0.06144111,0.029763611,0.02852125,0.01666408,0.046840668,0.08711259,0.0021300234,0.027108015,-0.004289258,0.06316433,0.009912876,-0.05616609,-0.035281084,0.012050159,-0.0103087565,0.06467675,-0.04812323,-0.02359638,-0.029400542,0.054054547,-0.011225352,-0.0072683543,-0.03965791,-0.044095326,-0.09810694,0.052123006,-0.00018892455,0.022946155,0.028661655,0.027101189,-0.050888818,0.030449457,-0.031450767,-0.020778222,0.1265727,0.034921695,-0.01186343,-0.014477371,0.0017491981,-0.044411615,-0.021866262,-0.043781705,0.059578866,0.05725521,-5.000087e-08,-0.073209286,-0.05988184,-0.047783583,-0.06799121,0.0016914865,-0.080935396,0.05790735,0.115071304,0.041217398,-0.010693555,0.11550018,-0.052596,-0.083752595,-7.1268194e-05,0.062878594,0.07149873,0.038234167,0.046714716,-0.042897325,0.052103773,0.019975837,0.023239296,-0.046375196,-0.072998606,0.0056264247,-0.05045333,0.026228217,0.13655965,0.07095325,0.014290048,0.010210753,-0.025542835,0.017867656,-0.034863416,-0.00371605,0.044463523,0.049519043,-0.000912891,-0.035480283,0.048807442,-0.050862502,0.032453813,-0.032674078,-0.030643934,0.021158677,0.06142512,0.018282402,-0.052553184,-0.011072531,-0.018538743,-0.054611124,-0.0052349563,0.017435946,0.08739963,0.046246998,0.064219944,-0.009612724,0.09909602,0.012126785,-0.050724596,0.01576601,-0.07784868,-0.043787904,-0.015992964,2,17.227537,16.409922,11
399,"in today's class we learnt some more things about variance inflation factor or vif. we latch on to the highest value and remove it and recalculate the vif. if we change vif threshold to like 5 then it will just be all those features with r square corresponding to five or less. if there is some important feature then we have to keep it irrespective of its vif. at last we can create classification model with left out variables.
then we learnt about pca or principal component analysis.principal components are necessarily perpendicular to each other. if we have 10pcs then we can decide like upto 2 or 3 are important .
eg - pc1 captures the best variance , pc2 : second best and so on....
now instead of y=f(x), we will have y= f(pc) ,  this is pc regression instead of normal regression , we can use pc for prediction but not for what if or explain the results.
purposes of pca analysis are dimension reduction, data reduction, prediction models and visualisation or understanding the structure of data using eda
pca is sensitive to data scale so we need to normalise the data beforehand.
then we learnt about t-sne or t-distributed stochastic neighbour encoding which helps to map multidimension data to 2 or 3 dimension",0.0035348998,-0.057650466,-0.030513933,-0.042274684,0.020732973,0.07069603,-0.062678665,0.047980297,0.059394527,0.059624758,-0.02970622,0.057932165,-0.09960639,0.0820366,-0.04424552,-0.04715259,0.07570844,0.06863825,-0.08034843,0.017391996,0.052357595,-0.06170828,-0.046844456,0.028713157,-0.068092234,0.058041062,-0.011340043,0.016148174,-0.0050263167,0.037767954,0.0070086294,0.05941284,0.04999053,-0.006450667,-0.083331436,0.024923133,0.017182367,0.034675106,-0.06295637,0.0358565,-0.0372233,-0.051980894,-0.046432763,0.052014746,0.1575635,-0.003117018,-0.008712646,-0.12457059,0.0017510689,-0.048042916,-0.036760356,0.016210135,-0.08289871,-0.017222622,-0.029047586,0.01225255,0.003041158,-0.084245056,0.0043324744,-0.063599445,-0.030347098,-0.04779707,0.0031762945,-0.002137889,0.06348114,-0.048710033,-0.022939261,0.032249954,0.025024178,0.036527365,-0.042012658,0.019249778,-0.016583996,-0.005353113,-0.03453395,0.04101987,-0.00030911234,-0.010230001,0.031355023,-0.0102674365,0.112472914,0.108902596,-0.00027087354,-0.023360366,0.017332193,0.017893797,-0.0054898043,-0.025009781,-0.061286025,-0.01850873,0.13525774,0.053984802,0.06529542,-0.02682153,0.046879113,0.002743494,-0.011284879,-0.102669306,0.06852426,0.00904125,-0.013342754,-0.041658487,0.033754792,0.03824081,-0.045811675,-0.055588678,-0.033960804,-0.003581316,0.07227567,-0.052638005,-0.0925122,0.051284313,-0.107714854,-0.027123094,0.09819755,-0.00942167,-0.024757598,0.07921808,0.05650893,0.01371267,-0.050788593,-0.066210665,0.023669759,0.035288062,0.091393046,0.023874722,-0.09392674,8.450379e-33,0.022957591,0.03284049,-0.03565293,0.043667708,-0.059436627,-0.029732605,0.05909197,-0.031973824,0.10272605,0.07079561,0.035755187,0.021395195,0.035356928,0.04227535,0.025563218,-0.0024524822,-0.017463356,0.023717167,0.014521045,-0.04019336,0.05267108,-0.044385705,0.16312,-0.017986633,-0.03960153,-0.08069143,-0.0868875,-0.06813407,-0.04656463,-0.024994873,-0.04348514,0.026360063,-0.04279931,0.02941289,-0.033363696,-0.04577816,0.021700481,-0.0713926,0.101891585,-0.03187008,0.017507946,0.036318757,0.05603802,-0.055491325,-0.015155888,0.046348546,0.025267815,-0.015223643,-0.08356176,0.026947716,-0.008855849,-0.015914535,-0.013690091,-0.021868477,-0.019309057,0.05179367,0.0420242,-0.080835566,-0.04884548,-0.022006106,-0.08362691,-0.0203373,0.006749777,-0.05336789,-0.028898926,-0.037581816,-0.008099708,0.017591668,0.0076614544,-0.012366791,-0.0438071,0.021001164,-0.065320924,-0.068393365,0.0664747,0.019009655,-0.053401195,-0.018206071,-0.00289002,-0.025458235,-0.09295466,0.11452009,0.0116007095,-0.06129604,0.02673622,-0.044446502,0.047475304,-0.09103777,0.030706855,-0.07105767,-0.04275712,0.0051903464,0.07940407,0.019305479,0.017361037,-9.08462e-33,-0.09647488,0.060286373,-0.09741183,0.09240793,0.019415919,-0.031442933,-0.037484903,-0.08836886,0.012569952,-0.07800439,0.05645171,0.027141001,0.042845614,-0.02262825,0.0035391804,0.05458331,-0.031886525,-0.024205372,-0.05595359,-0.07884569,-0.021669392,-0.047830224,-0.04990926,-0.0028968155,0.002308959,0.0026154995,-0.041257944,-0.060685545,0.010351127,-0.003485859,-0.047233555,0.04657072,-0.009738264,0.079485916,0.046449028,-0.023908446,-0.016638035,-0.07791058,0.04491179,0.08690791,0.035863854,0.1157809,0.03348497,-0.010941331,-0.06055807,-0.031556357,0.060960297,0.10723749,0.032172155,-0.029202541,0.10903419,0.02093145,0.03196592,-0.010659268,0.013158127,0.046272557,0.085688904,-0.051466215,0.034043822,0.028222883,0.07969785,0.013127686,-0.05526688,0.049520135,-0.07214922,0.049200144,0.03900737,0.033160962,-0.00418896,-0.059508797,-0.007123093,0.021635082,0.013084939,-0.018096915,-0.071175,-0.089432254,-0.009881565,-0.009550551,0.052210595,0.043576077,-0.034968935,-0.025439337,0.010535319,-0.05221613,-0.024030115,0.055985793,0.07840316,-0.026767276,0.031871658,-0.08200531,-0.046997834,-0.053038888,-0.01624643,0.06860891,0.075679414,-6.408001e-08,-0.05902897,-0.078390315,0.020295776,-0.037876476,0.059521925,-0.07086905,0.008199008,0.08332309,0.027996052,0.06301971,0.062265474,-0.008386673,-0.08135379,0.032068048,0.059805382,0.07934513,0.08415248,0.068975076,-0.041622557,0.023929227,0.03777787,-0.032769658,-0.038854618,-0.057310227,0.08453197,-0.066192485,0.009374931,0.09683955,0.038821418,0.04997199,0.0103987,-0.0070266123,-0.006774978,-0.028609585,0.015894752,0.058679964,0.04704964,-0.04290527,-0.02365676,0.044102773,-0.037230138,-0.06268576,-0.027278561,-0.01070577,0.010071081,0.044088166,-0.032997515,-0.017963624,-0.016963312,-0.023564355,-0.06902809,0.022041222,-0.022635821,0.038948786,0.033196103,0.05546658,0.022126202,0.012726232,-0.012995966,-0.06042388,-0.01818618,0.0338323,0.00093902997,-0.0567018,2,19.084194,15.607964,11
401,"in this session, we explored the variance inflation factor (vif) and principal component analysis (pca), focusing on their applications, differences, and use cases.

variance inflation factor (vif):

used to detect multicollinearity among features.
computed as 
vif=1/1-r^2, where r^2 is obtained by regressing a feature against all others.
a vif threshold of 10 (corresponding to r^2 = 0.9) is commonly used for feature elimination.
preserves real-world features, making it suitable for sensitivity analysis and interpretability in models.

principal component analysis (pca):

transforms features into new uncorrelated components (pcs) ranked by variance.
pc1 > pc2 > pc3 in terms of variance captured, with a decreasing trend in the explained variance graph.
common applications include dimensionality reduction, data visualization (e.g., pc1 vs. pc2 plots), and prediction modeling.
requires normalization to ensure fair variance contribution from all features.
unlike vif, pca does not retain original features, making sensitivity analysis difficult.

comparison:

vif works in feature space, removing redundant variables while keeping real-world interpretability.
pca creates mathematical features, making it more suitable for dimensionality reduction rather than feature selection.
vif is often preferred over pca when feature interpretability is essential.

additionally, the emnist dataset was mentioned as an example for handwritten digit classification using pca.

t-sne:  t-sne is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique primarily used for visualizing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space (typically 2d or 3d). 

how t-sne works:
measures similarity in high dimensions:
computes the probability that two points are neighbors in the original high-dimensional space using a gaussian distribution.
maps data to lower dimensions:
assigns similar points in a lower-dimensional space using a studentâ€™s t-distribution, ensuring that points that were close in high-dimensional space remain close.
optimizes for local structure:
unlike pca (which captures global variance), t-sne preserves local neighborhoods, making it great for cluster visualization.",0.005152112,-0.06471041,0.0013813914,0.030741245,0.08163646,0.01476858,-0.067757815,-0.01608598,0.04074431,0.0007346572,-0.008389371,-0.019361032,-0.07806561,0.08631883,-0.01865792,-0.026191024,0.10375847,0.052398887,-0.07698445,-0.03378572,0.038015485,-0.031838063,-0.057391535,0.038970415,0.030656785,0.0125561,-0.042776003,0.02251173,-0.0016689262,0.02570059,0.0044116997,0.0497747,-0.003579401,-0.028110314,-0.06469417,0.029911362,0.044634007,0.057103034,-0.09485454,-0.0062959287,-0.001200256,0.002077822,-0.022400217,0.036344174,0.14673412,-0.0028944423,-0.065632895,-0.06253151,0.023952018,-0.013446843,-0.04850629,-0.012840759,-0.06950408,0.035278577,0.002829102,0.008754036,-0.013024028,-0.037537824,0.04676509,-0.024935609,-0.024026198,-0.004345608,0.033001654,0.025180824,0.081809185,0.0020014984,0.00255636,-0.034191955,0.0026815496,0.008531042,-0.09100748,0.055774573,-0.048209473,-0.016518401,-0.0023510177,0.09685384,-0.037490945,0.0015069877,0.07945631,-0.008349228,0.04732825,0.06051267,-0.0070097935,-0.030332567,0.04288859,-0.017384557,0.0137694655,-0.07494576,-0.034728773,0.07043841,0.082752466,0.061440453,0.04954151,-0.0061681992,-0.04477871,-0.01011809,0.048900645,-0.084086016,-0.0003074903,0.0809342,-0.0045472793,-0.063845165,0.043352973,0.035905715,0.005882948,-0.05246583,-0.00943955,-0.012520224,0.01329147,-0.016109874,-0.045657724,0.009309071,-0.07718224,-0.032382213,0.038668666,0.01933407,0.039214134,0.040055275,0.07352289,0.051337186,-0.0006162697,-0.07024714,0.053178035,0.029589325,0.07219744,0.07252437,-0.07934585,7.125379e-33,0.024575396,0.014230074,-0.0022822462,-0.008652183,-0.04955329,-0.031518776,-0.0333118,-0.01763143,0.06483904,0.04122361,-0.001903907,0.07731601,-0.021225668,0.039949194,0.03209265,-0.0062292195,-0.008840034,0.017715536,0.031640593,-0.052322496,0.064039275,-0.063623235,0.045932505,-0.0013169188,-0.055644196,-0.04561605,-0.0821145,-0.0141806835,-0.052753292,-0.004182797,-0.05698836,0.06625167,-0.007078811,0.021269256,-0.09459623,-0.09742454,-0.008727447,-0.10332329,0.13699053,-0.0046453713,-0.015905682,-0.0067577376,0.027440906,-0.08423382,-0.037601642,0.022503976,0.06166946,-0.055967566,-0.045135118,0.021067336,-0.011203766,0.044393856,-0.0082976855,0.010401498,-0.052027237,0.071034834,0.06723487,-0.06880459,-0.0057233227,-0.018383022,-0.11472744,0.0455516,0.017675458,-0.061788976,-0.056068137,-0.038267605,-0.0070304396,0.060513236,-0.0567911,0.0063565173,-0.06511554,-0.0029271543,-0.022703765,-0.072769135,0.0031288022,-0.042756952,-0.013989881,0.010338971,0.0043639466,-0.041567404,-0.1024532,0.061629895,0.041923955,-0.011268909,0.005865381,-0.060957815,-0.020278092,-0.091186084,-0.02509569,-0.10770025,-0.008007999,0.07212114,0.09934797,-0.010030786,0.035969656,-6.565796e-33,-0.093571335,0.05698904,-0.03187583,0.10842018,0.013160978,-0.060860503,-0.047820818,-0.059833378,0.02282019,-0.095229216,0.023725316,-0.013911821,0.010545073,-0.008505672,0.07060737,0.06508179,-0.01539425,0.019732947,-0.032758404,-0.044492796,-0.0029856304,-0.034419283,-0.057086825,-0.008580493,-0.02625794,-0.048921723,-0.043882843,-0.09610101,-0.031413842,-0.03300795,-0.089397445,0.13441764,-0.031887244,0.02651234,0.0466971,-0.053555366,-0.05171532,-0.10532154,0.0057634846,0.07363826,0.09328629,0.102409475,0.018829012,0.028476035,-0.014125524,0.021739827,0.075964816,0.06157003,0.06323268,0.012449059,-0.0021121197,0.035789687,0.050633777,0.029797114,-0.020148158,0.027016416,0.0855255,-0.0301544,0.07563349,0.03470428,0.039070763,-0.012768389,-0.030638913,-0.040032938,0.014236049,0.0035819707,0.03838132,0.013653449,-0.0018226433,-0.023163022,0.08373944,-0.008647945,0.0025276989,-0.039927777,-0.047153767,-0.078143656,0.0072023976,-0.0022712308,-0.008639841,-0.00549137,0.035855334,-0.0008489926,0.074294,-0.069351755,-0.023954112,0.11035105,-0.011945519,-0.02890253,-0.008058953,-0.005503466,-0.049956627,0.02634317,-0.061138682,0.09784546,0.038734775,-4.9216418e-08,-0.063465044,-0.008575779,-0.041059446,-0.084220275,0.018761788,-0.06551754,0.03117691,0.10415908,0.004786261,0.013503131,0.13049035,-0.04600904,-0.1013936,0.01506942,0.06696664,0.095966324,0.03841156,0.078943856,-0.045848586,0.009565105,0.02607751,-0.0012188227,-0.0140260095,-0.07305117,0.08678571,-0.08145225,0.020802189,0.16941677,0.0893732,0.016012345,-0.0033069355,0.004666143,0.05579451,-0.006860778,0.024974862,0.108397014,0.07733792,-0.007991073,-0.047888916,0.06983133,-0.048795957,0.06889012,-0.08506582,-0.017871132,0.00065409986,0.05757222,0.034262955,-0.049559496,-0.0062204753,-0.0026470597,-0.037956297,-0.00540865,-0.02293732,0.089785084,0.038590267,0.039105278,-0.011205137,0.06125993,-0.0068268757,-0.024386534,0.0020880054,-0.05561975,-0.022071453,-0.025660776,2,16.684969,16.520678,11
421,"today we discussed a bit about vif and how a threshold should be selected with a reason. and we moved to pca, a technique that helps us reduce dimensionality. so in pca the pc axes are all orthogonal to each other, and they are linear combination of the initial features. pc1 has the highest variance, followed by pc2 and so on.
between vif and pca, vif ids thee one that should be done first as it gives an idea of the multicollinearity of the features that is more pressing to know and then pca can be used for visualization of the data.
there was another technique discussed for visualization, which was tsne, which gives a depiction in 2 dimensions. but this transformation is a lossy one. its comparatively slower as it is a stochastic process involving the t distribution.",0.052834816,-0.045629065,-0.048716873,-0.10549327,0.018071616,-0.025110524,-0.034503303,0.016582485,0.09237729,0.016584923,0.005614255,0.018544517,-0.06185708,0.042667195,-0.03208653,-0.05732659,0.07184838,0.039133377,-0.02514828,-0.009690422,0.009449435,-0.039524063,-0.030207716,-0.043839253,-0.02078558,0.008743087,0.018785678,0.026693275,0.013095765,0.012220658,-0.016016446,0.06431211,-0.016540896,-0.010939269,-0.072461545,-0.003993204,0.02324745,0.04789257,-0.06494154,-0.010429324,-0.04094599,0.0441268,-0.050489362,0.056268368,0.060735058,0.0076593626,-0.02746416,-0.09189705,0.028227642,-0.04393335,-0.070155144,-0.008016149,-0.07850191,0.007427389,-0.034200877,0.03590481,0.011464875,-0.10729038,0.044557832,0.02213197,0.012127834,0.02694792,0.07072486,0.033163305,0.13384631,0.0043933378,0.01524858,-0.014229802,0.0149919065,-0.011825211,-0.08640945,0.018478245,-0.07057569,-0.03324443,-0.06763283,0.033134606,-0.057005625,-0.015112576,0.03323018,-0.067352355,0.06798649,0.11114817,-0.010590758,0.052218203,-0.01302834,0.032374643,-0.006051084,-0.049052775,-0.021086115,0.012940713,0.060988463,0.06738131,0.014229503,-0.03803835,0.017521748,-0.07496191,0.063174985,-0.1393612,0.10603368,0.02785888,-0.03646071,-0.1177554,0.08028822,0.026936635,-0.0084418375,-0.072060004,0.022619348,-0.0033334678,0.026225636,-0.037290078,-0.028034465,0.07265878,-0.06836289,0.0003041232,0.063813664,0.023416335,-0.030451322,0.09973161,0.079033844,0.0031996572,-0.022126116,-0.060311098,-0.03982426,0.021573406,0.09022794,0.018149123,-0.030086044,2.6065305e-33,0.03433682,0.0062353928,-0.011246188,0.03126817,-0.006301363,0.013361534,-0.005288403,-0.1610295,0.057103198,0.10931872,-0.05094252,-0.005717949,0.06581781,0.081711486,0.025787313,-0.07892925,0.014902537,0.050577205,-0.041758344,-0.037344806,0.025451757,0.02737548,0.11922427,-0.0015262454,-0.024292605,-0.07706127,-0.12673797,-0.08675758,0.008030423,-0.012284738,-0.08996417,0.058823224,-0.058590446,-0.054116555,-0.021694696,-0.04624714,-0.0042186934,-0.06019594,0.07397789,-0.0021577072,0.025617402,0.027055068,0.029020026,-0.05484427,-0.04397488,0.045726158,0.032395136,0.010027125,-0.038071018,-0.0244465,0.016796317,0.0056541394,-0.047399186,-0.048573308,0.022885345,0.05193811,0.092124194,-0.09037687,-0.016210925,0.023002613,-0.04140287,-0.015516535,0.002188573,-0.036651585,-0.00037835774,-0.06450495,-0.064053945,-0.020438382,-0.0050078607,0.035626926,-0.045024276,0.03725459,-0.025132457,-0.08565827,0.028661126,0.01592737,-0.036804702,0.031611532,-0.0008628405,-0.010712328,-0.14928955,0.016473271,0.0048731975,-0.12103788,0.027332589,-0.044155434,0.04160905,-0.07292665,-0.043847468,-0.09010654,-0.033755034,0.053848233,0.071162194,-0.008426566,0.030520769,-4.7487073e-33,-0.10900356,0.081109755,0.011851362,0.068103805,0.012079169,-0.004856807,-0.02542124,-0.010055422,-0.02567948,0.008601176,0.0264067,-0.043123577,-0.0648684,-0.08897125,0.04299411,0.013871488,0.07609239,0.0047800886,-0.063528374,-0.089490354,0.022318365,0.00051984633,-0.03734241,-0.005020268,-0.004108084,0.004535574,-0.012627764,-0.055424377,-0.06424091,-0.021333907,-0.047274698,0.024677673,-0.007780845,0.093722396,0.064951815,0.022683026,0.026965728,-0.11442949,0.028015746,0.07282898,-0.0031238068,0.05641875,0.033386692,0.0547555,-0.08458319,0.0019300692,0.043070294,0.07437146,-0.0036243733,-0.01080829,0.051685564,0.11801179,0.06668583,-0.011505299,0.010593895,0.021000119,0.015120309,-0.06146237,0.063126326,0.023372693,0.045183476,-0.035996646,-0.05428691,0.0063608903,-0.011125464,-0.020604573,0.050681654,-0.008205501,-0.007886113,-0.027852494,0.083954096,0.0043553472,-0.012415522,-0.04066523,-0.0042915805,-0.16326539,0.0392667,0.016323656,0.00011271111,0.015744759,0.044434737,-0.02483171,0.06745837,0.014368622,-0.022142239,0.11399152,0.025570648,-0.08693735,0.075738326,0.00042828626,-0.0019152847,-0.035215896,-0.060776748,0.08293622,0.110370964,-5.0946934e-08,-0.077637926,-0.03637988,-0.014840199,-0.075428784,0.0561511,-0.05948822,0.024854697,0.13905166,0.0029510513,-0.010672861,0.026683407,-0.020566072,-0.08238993,-0.017816998,0.06465751,0.07330209,-0.008726708,0.0458549,0.007722405,0.030850122,0.0038318955,-0.005874251,-0.05071018,-0.050776888,-0.027884502,0.013670641,-0.024892876,0.06646384,0.023428317,0.012417567,0.01688581,-0.0047590034,0.05827457,0.013312772,0.015256018,-0.008297232,0.020013979,0.038372394,-0.08105053,0.04155939,-0.04503513,0.019534739,0.008858919,0.010797967,0.009819791,0.09609665,0.009020913,-0.007813782,0.04892131,-0.021692785,-0.024318755,0.00045760866,0.049273364,0.08995986,0.0014210938,0.038788557,-0.0074252943,0.07479916,0.01569003,-0.015652599,-0.022687798,-0.009398905,-0.032106202,-0.044019844,2,19.638826,13.544117,11
449,"we want to minimize the number of features to counteract the curse of dimensionality. variance inflation factor (vif) assists in identifying multicollinearity between independent variables and needs to be run prior to principal component analysis (pca), as pca does not eliminate redundancy but projects the feature space. r-square quantifies the amount of variance explained by the model but does not reveal multicollinearity. there is a compromise between the number of features and r-squareâ€”increasing the number of features can increase r-square but at the cost of instability. pca, which is an application of singular value decomposition (svd), is a dimensionality reduction technique that creates principal components (pcs) that are orthogonal and ordered by variance explained. the first pc explains the most variance, followed by the rest of the pcs. this conversion enables dimensionality reduction of a multi-dimensional data set to fewer dimensions (e.g., reducing a 2d problem to 1d). pca, however, diminishes interpretability, as ""what-if"" analysis is not possible because pcs are mathematical abstractions and not actual features.it is mostly used for dimensionality reduction, predictive modeling, and visualization in exploratory data analysis (eda) to decide between ordinary regression and pca regression. while pca is good at reducing high-dimensional data, it is at the expense of interpretability as it complicates the linking of predictions to original variables. another dimensionality reduction method, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-sne), differs from pca in that it uses a probabilistic approach rather than a linear transformation. t-sne constructs a probability distribution for each point, estimating the

474,"in this class, sir told that he will discuss about data problems. if the correlation between data is not proper, we use variance inflation factor. vif=1-/(1-r^2). vif= 10 occurs for r^2 around 0.8. we progressively keep eliminating the variables with higher values of vif.  if we go on removing variables with high vif values, we will have some variables with low vif values which have high r^2 square values. we need to remove some variables to eliminate the curse of dimensionality. another method to handle data problems is principal component analysis. principle components are orthogonal to each other. we can find principal components equal to the dimension of data. we transform axis so that transformed axes capture variance of data best. we plot graph of two variables x1 and x2 say. if the points are spread around a straight line passing through origin, this straight line will be a principle component. this line will capture most of the variance. if we create plot % variance explained by each principle component, this is known as elbow curve. based on this curve we eliminate variables. but the problem with this is pc1=c11.x1+c12.x2+.....-linear combination of all variables, where c11,c12,c13,... are called loadings. we have to perform vif first and then use pca. interpretability- after doing pca, y=f(pc) using this we can do prediction or do 'what if analysis'. but it is difficult to explain the results of prediction or what if analysis with pca. because pca are a mathematical representation of variables. we will lose explain ability if we perform pca. vif reduces the features, so we do vif first and see if many features are getting eliminated. then we can do pca if required. pc analysis- dimension reduction, prediction models and visualization. lets consider image data- dimensionality of this data is number of pixels. before pca we might need to normalise the data. mnist data set is a collection of hand written numbers. these have been converted into 28x28 pixels. we want to train a classifier which can recognise numbers. we perform pca on this data and realise that there are 784 variables but only 70-80 are useful. this also results in data reduction. then we can do 2d and 3d plots to visualise this data. pca is mathematically exact. if our idea is to visualise the data effectively we need to tsne. t distribution- derived from gaussian distribution and it is more spread out as compared to gaussian distribution. tsne is a lossy transform, we loose exactness of data and gain relative closeness of data. tsne is lossy transformation, so use it carefully. the process of tsne itself give the structure of data. t-sne is a machine learning algorithm that is used for dimensionality reduction and data visualisation. it works by finding the similarity measures between pairs of instances in higher and lower dimensional spaces and tries to maintain the probability distribution for data samples in lower dimensions same as the probability distribution of data samples in higher dimensions. t-sne- t-distributed stochastic neighbour encoding.

484,"vif (variance inflation factor)
purpose: vif is used to detect multicollinearity in regression models.
process: we progressively removed values of ei (likely referring to certain features or variables).
outcome: the test was conducted in code 2, and it helped in removing extra features.

bca (principal component analysis)
principal components (pc):
  principal components are orthogonal, meaning they are uncorrelated.
  the maximum number of components is equal to the number of dimensions in the original dataset.

variance explained by components:
  the first principal component (pc1) explains most of the variance in the data.
  the second principal component (pc2) explains the next largest portion of the variance, and so on.

loadings:
  if pc1 is a linear combination of original features, say c1x1 + c2x2 + c3x3, the parameters c1, c2, c3 are called loadings.
  the loading values indicate the strength of influence that each variable has on the component. for example, if c3 is large for pc1, then x3 (the original variable) greatly influences the variance explained by pc1.

multicollinearity:
  vif is typically calculated first to detect and address multicollinearity, which can be an issue in regression models.

loss of interpretability with pca:
  one downside of pca is that it loses interpretability. for instance, if x1 is a known parameter, we cannot easily quantify how changes in x1 will affect the result after applying pca.

uses of pca:
  dimension reduction: pca helps reduce the number of variables, making the data easier to handle.
  prediction models: pca can be used to create more efficient predictive models.
  visualization: pca is often used for visualizing high-dimensional data by reducing it to two or three dimensions.

choosing between models:
  there is a choice between using y = fx (where f is a matrix of features) or using y = pcs (principal components).
  it is generally better to normalize the data before performing pca to ensure that all features are treated equally in terms of their influence on the components.

mnist dataset and normalization
normalization importance:
  pca on the mnist dataset highlighted the importance of normalizing the data. normalization ensures that all features contribute equally to the principal components.

t-sne (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding)
overview: t-sne is a lossy transformation technique that is commonly used for dimensionality reduction and visualization, particularly for high-dimensional data.

methodology:
  t-sne uses gradient descent and stochastic methods.
  step 1: create a probability distribution for each observation in the dataset.
  more accurately, we calculate a distribution that represents the distance between each point and every other point in the dataset.
  hence, there are n x n distributions, where n is the number of data points.

why t-distribution:
  a t-distribution is used because it is flatter compared to a normal distribution, making it more sensitive to long-distance points. this helps in maintaining the relationships between distant points.

goal: the goal of t-sne is to minimize the kullback-leibler (kl) divergence, which measures the difference between the original high-dimensional probability distribution and the low-dimensional projection.

491,"in this session, we covered methods of analyzing and condensing high-dimensional data without sacrificing interpretability. we started by talking about heatmaps, which, while perhaps not showing all the minute variations, are well worth it to compare several parameters at once. heatmaps facilitate rapid pairwise comparisons that would be difficult to view individually, thus serving as an effective tool when performing exploratory data analysis (eda).

the variance inflation factor (vif) was subsequently developed as a multicollinearity diagnostic. vif measures the extent to which a particular parameter is accounted for by the other parameters in the data. for any feature, a large vif means that the feature is strongly redundant with others. if a feature's vif is greater than some chosen threshold, it should be eliminated to prevent multicollinearityâ€”a problem that is frequently more important than the requirement for dimensionality reduction through pca.

principal component analysis (pca) was explained as a technique that employs singular value decomposition to project data onto new, mutually orthogonal components. the principal components cover the original dataset's complete dimensionality, yet you can opt to keep only the most important ones in order to bring down the dimensionality. the kept components are weighted sums of the original features, whose weights are referred to as loadings. although pca is ideal for prediction, visualization in the context of eda, and data compression capturing the largest amount of variance, it is less ideal for ""what if"" or sensitivity analysis because the transformed components do not map directly onto the original parameters. in addition, pca is sensitive to scaling of the data, so normalization is necessary.

by contrast, t-sne employs a t-distribution and stochastic gradient descent to create a low-dimensional lossy representation of high-dimensional data. while giving up on precise distances, t-sne performs very well on preserving the relative proximity of the data points, and thus is very effective for visualizing clusters and intricate patterns.",0.030958047,-0.024001952,0.035963073,-0.0061708223,0.08421426,0.04195611,-0.046361957,-0.02288149,0.025600435,0.015537934,-0.010990842,-0.00066302536,-0.09816991,0.039536085,-0.028489972,-0.044140488,0.055599824,0.027755532,-0.08135424,-0.019073922,-0.002155956,-0.013938601,-0.085868634,0.050695654,-0.01499204,0.048290685,-0.00012590148,-0.00916063,-0.024737643,0.040984422,0.0014281969,0.12635341,-0.030174213,0.00167758,0.00032776908,0.074953444,0.028264837,0.051543027,-0.11287037,0.008467013,0.021118863,-0.0023025183,-0.040395826,0.05277132,0.08375792,0.0003690289,-0.03508012,-0.10069431,-0.01527488,-0.023944344,-0.021049716,0.040287986,-0.049545333,0.022009404,-0.019864751,-0.062130984,-0.019434642,-0.07105185,0.052540302,0.017853051,-0.04713078,-0.0259235,0.014185626,-0.018914875,0.09110848,-0.0069994614,0.034092262,-0.08490777,-0.031028537,0.06223038,-0.05010449,0.050785176,-0.048839413,0.0075707654,0.0027425752,0.049831476,-0.015420827,-0.026150092,0.09391662,-0.03472659,0.082118124,0.10300436,-0.0095838895,-0.011412004,0.017648494,-0.014147879,0.04488987,-0.08495631,-0.028870868,0.028042007,0.08036463,0.061905764,0.027268566,-0.01847275,0.02888705,-0.01655277,0.024165796,-0.08589197,0.051029958,0.005984631,-0.008312543,-0.06987879,0.041486695,0.042305715,-0.034883294,-0.102901794,0.012721203,0.010584186,0.023726892,-0.015168624,-0.034602307,0.0071046134,-0.01943438,-0.03853759,0.08147893,-0.045144025,-0.009867534,0.04931656,0.07809536,0.019416621,-0.020315832,-0.052493177,0.052070573,0.021586252,0.085211806,0.044612363,-0.037390754,8.145822e-33,0.04786141,0.05797913,-0.010241353,0.0042593223,-0.06186017,-0.031365473,0.009453376,-0.06699317,0.06417627,0.07803441,-0.023715539,0.09986736,-0.011314388,0.06738048,-0.016107883,0.0046205474,-0.008544267,0.05476546,-0.038640026,-0.05555205,0.0370266,-0.051309012,0.10191306,-0.03125185,-0.048644528,-0.08691981,-0.05774637,-0.029556794,-0.07036657,0.0019355873,-0.06519408,0.03250933,-0.059537217,0.10232657,-0.020278808,-0.04979268,0.013805356,-0.063993864,0.11956277,-0.0055616857,-0.0049908194,-0.0027160528,0.030168317,-0.034113362,-0.03860121,0.059391573,0.0046134256,-0.007544147,-0.0728086,-0.010591591,0.014617061,0.041342653,0.026252821,-0.025820386,-0.07685562,0.069687776,0.022512794,-0.082891434,0.013803532,0.017173616,-0.107095905,0.045008704,-0.013181406,-0.04669201,-0.0304766,-0.09078138,-0.022638347,0.024935246,0.015345313,-0.022256201,-0.054206774,-0.025400555,0.00020306403,-0.12240733,0.029345766,-0.059043396,0.05557052,0.06372816,-0.0069505665,0.019000346,-0.07426942,0.037792914,0.06521486,-0.08071778,-0.0027755708,-0.122858346,0.03197262,-0.071765095,-0.04630123,-0.09318206,-0.030427746,0.0622103,0.09949681,0.009122996,0.046096813,-6.989225e-33,-0.033116195,-0.021663303,0.014959007,0.09853542,-0.0074305963,-0.06072944,-0.052327685,-0.02764081,-0.036830816,-0.117670454,0.074851446,-0.06969253,-0.011572581,-0.06316469,0.0388227,0.08225864,-0.014420656,-0.007731677,0.0045332466,0.008676473,-0.019594286,-0.057680573,-0.035822447,-0.023435168,-0.06671315,-0.039770048,0.02210842,-0.11494682,-0.023208866,-0.041941546,-0.052583754,0.0690171,-0.07176224,0.07889158,0.0053842478,-0.0232045,0.01376318,-0.08058566,0.018495116,0.078464516,0.067688756,0.07312458,0.018387368,-0.0016708199,-0.01808209,-0.010671015,0.05582813,0.054728955,0.008181732,0.052074067,0.06477401,0.021945678,0.03397562,0.06984739,0.014855878,0.013295034,0.07689681,-0.037793625,0.054605436,0.016743919,0.06509586,-0.03573642,-0.0346776,0.0062484387,0.044709317,0.025971945,0.07088074,-0.064657114,-0.00035223665,-0.03333637,0.011390327,-0.044350803,-0.024496743,-0.023707617,-0.016547455,-0.062145863,-0.021378359,-0.014733824,0.0012136085,0.012670706,0.041852057,-0.0010902685,0.004896528,-0.012947076,-0.017015008,0.10973444,0.0239081,-0.025455054,-0.0016476663,-0.017981587,0.020394921,-0.030329132,-0.032489896,0.11428972,0.039008748,-5.8941946e-08,-0.04240247,-0.015480241,-0.05429813,-0.123767726,0.07103938,-0.12410727,0.050353684,0.16251172,0.049397014,0.07281534,0.12792897,-0.017518446,-0.03503725,0.008655398,0.0808257,-0.0014403806,0.019174904,0.022353826,-0.01886326,0.032732364,0.03799253,0.025073588,-0.035984654,-0.033844113,0.08375372,-0.011229889,0.044007204,0.12474879,0.06987293,0.017456662,-0.014907715,0.013791056,-0.014876944,-0.05989267,-0.008676875,0.09706463,0.08819684,-0.016360318,-0.05876015,-0.008754015,-0.07038741,0.05177188,-0.037824385,-0.030044638,0.019115115,0.032788076,-0.009744347,0.004887671,0.026798379,0.04441926,-0.038729243,-0.009576663,0.04030142,0.08601347,-0.006447048,0.009188979,-0.012693982,0.05251096,0.04788214,-0.049157422,0.041405533,-0.025033474,-0.06772782,-0.041704983,2,17.504309,15.811178,11
512,"todayâ€™s discussion is mainly based on principal component analysis and t-sne. vif is used to detect multicollinearity by calculating how much the variance of a regression coefficient increases. so, the highest vif values indicates that the column in very dependent on others. in these we set a threshold and column having vif value higher than that will be drop out. 
having too many features in data can cause problems like overfitting, slower computation, and lower accuracy. this is called the curse of dimensionality where more features exponentially increase the data needed for reliable results. to tackle this problem we use dimensionality reduction in which we reduces the number of features. pca is one of the methods to do it. it works by transforming high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while maximizing the variance.
we create principal components which is the new axis where the data is most spread out. pcs are orthogonal to each others. the number of pcs are equal to the number of dimensions we have. pc1 are that axis which captures best variance in data. the general equation of principal components is pc1=c1x1 + c2x2 + c3x3 + c4x4 + .... where c1 is called loadings. predictions can be made through pca but we loses explain ability i.e. we can explain the results. principal component analysis have many features like data reduction, dimension reduction, prediction models, visualization (understanding the structure of data).
pca is sensitive to the data scale, we have to normalize the data before applying pca. we have seen an example on mnist dataset consists of handwritten digits. another method we learn is t-sne which stands for t-distribution stochastic neighbor encoding. it is a lossy transformation. it helps us to map multi-dimensional data to 2 dimensions or 3 dimensions.",0.0068188254,-0.015034947,0.04823672,-0.05956832,0.07612701,0.04620559,-0.050314162,0.014860749,0.0667096,0.002013141,-0.052349582,0.028842058,-0.04823912,0.04370668,-0.025719734,0.005110003,0.06807076,0.06253381,-0.07515737,-0.032440092,0.018269546,-0.069508284,-0.035663344,0.048885882,-0.038419597,0.040447902,0.007848814,-0.061505098,-0.026781034,0.02853003,0.027248632,0.104818456,-0.004485709,-0.029490465,-0.06538823,-0.0004421574,-0.035078116,0.07879691,-0.05368277,0.013788785,-0.0045858095,0.03177162,-0.03419435,0.044291884,0.110550135,0.03079735,-0.020447345,-0.110334136,0.032356072,-0.03569253,-0.012631881,0.030166682,-0.056710485,0.054888457,-0.02887885,-0.115211755,-0.045085356,-0.0372387,0.054070484,0.010798726,0.0492616,-0.03088336,0.045098774,-0.030687643,0.09828183,0.010743807,-0.014622477,0.01572725,-0.07099716,0.07320663,-0.039659478,0.05459412,-0.07617009,0.026437767,0.0101250755,0.056471225,-0.017106421,-0.028400162,0.11534886,0.010496204,0.073444426,0.104292326,-0.023112176,-0.02731365,0.073344454,-0.007816829,0.0015187201,-0.093126714,-0.055260465,-0.016259005,0.08362757,0.033553522,0.0836495,-0.014413102,-0.02950109,-0.055317663,0.03758154,-0.09899549,0.057690978,0.014798023,-0.039987203,-0.02945362,0.053079583,0.029782321,-0.00456375,-0.06991383,-0.022169808,0.006742473,0.06673354,-0.044534557,-0.041598756,0.00064104045,-0.10109273,-0.01558533,0.08444052,0.028338812,0.008923048,0.06310548,0.062866054,0.026359797,-0.049520377,-0.07741061,0.01962688,0.013258267,0.07751841,0.03763422,-0.09877046,1.0087803e-32,0.012145702,0.06544874,-0.037904184,-0.017685179,-0.018562524,-0.018268837,0.029926652,-0.036933158,0.062824965,0.08442555,-0.063562185,-0.003950577,0.03644787,0.05805913,0.05330318,-8.5384716e-05,0.00085897255,0.015790328,0.008352534,-0.036012422,0.062174674,-0.100819245,0.10159866,-0.013787632,-0.0152696995,-0.11929203,-0.0672241,-0.028619627,-0.019272322,-0.024746811,-0.07203737,0.029827623,-0.033845097,0.07768074,-0.014436242,-0.073479824,-0.024956377,-0.058032494,0.11873034,0.04041751,-0.006537899,0.004951198,0.012465271,-0.06669357,0.0139142675,0.078191474,-0.0028829798,-0.031047227,-0.10532722,0.028625224,0.024151782,0.03171075,-0.021207478,0.0038643081,-0.078025565,0.019757422,0.0016503965,-0.12072409,0.01683419,-0.03049125,-0.07798566,-0.04600803,-0.0052843657,-0.04313348,0.027347717,-0.099303484,0.010505384,0.03163403,0.022073463,0.006792536,-0.032196708,-0.025203526,-0.039672904,-0.117482565,0.042920887,-0.034997556,0.0057476573,0.04323826,-0.014278411,0.037270125,-0.10588113,0.08302896,0.030182073,-0.092899695,0.052273117,-0.044697937,0.026881717,-0.12543873,-0.045469902,-0.06824475,-0.0535388,0.04150469,0.05134921,0.016959066,0.018602073,-8.4230165e-33,-0.033947192,0.025841134,0.005462197,0.05267472,-0.0058954875,-0.035534512,-0.020030946,-0.07045029,-0.026571568,-0.09929489,0.055021755,-0.04102737,0.040786505,-0.014958787,0.027380168,0.05846242,-0.010982082,0.017515058,-0.009866821,-0.0071867104,-0.0111759,-0.061339747,-0.02290017,0.024223808,-0.035517737,-0.024647886,-0.047956828,-0.087552376,0.013599962,-0.025988711,-0.09498835,0.07160419,-0.04499135,0.078508474,0.019236684,0.0072360397,-0.04030387,-0.060248364,0.0539908,0.10853619,0.06268607,0.028869033,-0.018177068,0.018378016,-0.045974556,-0.009050509,0.027664613,0.0860954,0.027284455,0.03728654,0.05550683,0.05282561,0.041063104,0.035892636,0.07853683,0.034834918,0.062071517,-0.00832428,0.03924983,-0.0021688456,0.021184409,-0.008692984,-0.030897284,0.0823397,0.038008094,0.043346696,0.037018947,0.035375655,-0.021687005,-0.023232259,-0.0033894645,-0.0124715185,0.02868824,-0.023707734,-0.06577864,-0.07906226,-0.00916409,-0.052316397,0.02697566,0.023224687,0.0060126134,-0.041511722,0.013496774,-0.03775037,-0.009382936,0.06552172,0.04740609,-0.02778698,0.03026184,-0.012233763,-0.008389041,0.017095737,-0.010716568,0.043274004,0.057357814,-6.0017626e-08,-0.04946257,-0.0229982,-0.04652091,-0.1079295,0.06502387,-0.10278757,0.015147494,0.1663118,0.010806364,0.03456471,0.108269185,-0.03575524,-0.076612346,0.030280123,0.084896564,0.04693042,-0.04941433,0.043583952,-0.011406982,0.023964418,0.01855298,-0.039423745,-0.008128964,-0.06463889,0.08485706,-0.06793964,0.047750212,0.10620279,0.03909015,0.029287757,0.023894295,-0.044365205,0.0017820225,-0.022386635,0.0866939,0.07274486,0.07503276,-0.0075369803,-0.028724635,0.020308916,-0.05545369,0.015266415,-0.05232434,-0.024658322,0.050556373,0.041696515,0.02660196,-0.013717856,0.024272835,-0.00094591465,-0.031150749,0.018253973,0.03198721,0.061815433,0.021791356,0.052215844,-0.04235747,0.062611595,0.039833494,-0.080136605,-0.046053704,-0.03145809,-0.02613958,-0.064786606,2,18.059177,14.633875,11
535,"heatmaps are useful visualization tools for pairwise analysis when plotting all parameters individually is impractical, although they lack detailed numeric insights. variance inflation factor (vif) helps detect multicollinearity by measuring how much a feature's variance increases due to correlations with other features; features with high vif values above a certain threshold should be removed first to reduce multicollinearity. principal component analysis (pca), derived from singular value decomposition (svd), transforms correlated variables into orthogonal principal components (pcs), each being a weighted sum of original parameters (weights known as loadings). pca reduces dimensionality, aids prediction models, data compression, visualization, and exploratory data analysis (eda), but cannot perform sensitivity or ""what-if"" analysis since pcs aren't directly interpretable as original parameters. pca is sensitive to data scaling, thus normalization is necessary. in contrast, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-sne) employs a stochastic gradient descent approach based on t-distribution for nonlinear dimensionality reduction and visualization, preserving local relationships but losing exact numeric information (lossy transformation).",0.01583474,-0.047403958,0.023164479,0.00021220905,0.07386301,0.025703704,-0.10828672,-0.041786067,0.04239773,-0.0051766676,-0.035104882,0.012698011,0.00017516845,0.03344381,-0.043600008,-0.0044852453,0.07848791,0.06259478,-0.068609916,-0.07023355,-0.023199243,-0.04010343,-0.12099051,-0.055968452,0.03482919,0.0003207133,0.031401213,-0.01085528,-0.069538005,0.08196074,0.034518886,-0.009729297,-0.06666686,-0.019054072,-0.043850113,0.04843445,0.0072063757,0.08535876,-0.14942506,0.01686085,0.003706149,-0.023092518,-0.025630135,0.032580182,0.08675381,-0.022900563,-0.045510117,-0.06812127,-0.05493551,-0.010657389,0.016160104,-0.0055645853,-0.0910471,0.06507034,-0.004967396,0.039842553,-0.010929303,-0.093653865,0.018686691,0.0038775986,-0.0041275835,-0.027353153,0.030356374,0.001450744,0.087490186,-0.015238456,0.057246927,0.0037460166,0.024581466,0.028008638,-0.061730273,0.027459383,-0.019331932,0.038139235,-0.03992789,0.08651137,0.011021881,-0.046762943,0.10252949,-0.10467979,0.083180234,0.12842001,0.019232333,-0.03315469,0.048920717,0.014632463,0.019715466,-0.029739028,-0.0042052944,0.0471696,0.04926996,0.07155854,-0.075888015,-0.017395217,0.024516195,-0.06432662,-0.017583683,-0.046332307,0.013688504,0.0074232854,-0.0046729576,-0.040541984,0.049141277,0.0028146647,0.010234183,-0.07625555,0.037643787,-0.021045407,0.030765342,-0.019764226,-0.052848388,-0.0093755685,-0.07320965,0.017995493,0.0767806,-0.06742802,0.028987342,0.030966429,0.042557694,0.015208545,-0.054958507,-0.039602757,0.02843938,0.031460103,0.080531806,0.0083338255,-0.06694777,9.407948e-33,0.043611944,0.06736506,-0.033202056,0.0006175455,0.0026119652,-0.012349954,-0.022432715,-0.042386994,-0.014111373,0.083184406,-0.05618156,0.106853634,-0.0034169056,0.15119582,-0.011930377,0.0014726338,0.005518082,0.05162164,-0.043355454,-0.06237301,-0.009230512,-0.026779385,0.051399264,0.02846199,-0.020808384,-0.072286576,-0.027557788,0.03404633,-0.0115226945,0.005612029,-0.105906904,-0.01326972,-0.07662564,-0.034657188,-0.026899433,-0.022080828,-0.03600381,-0.058927953,0.055936076,-0.027581861,0.02339841,-0.017173544,0.024716651,-0.022504399,-0.047648184,0.045840133,0.0002904305,-0.025060927,-0.07372318,-0.07974184,0.017023273,-0.02221547,0.0008545437,-0.012870556,-0.06544542,0.047093347,0.08557258,-0.07310092,0.046265747,-0.025049897,-0.11488908,-0.0098804375,-0.016185006,-0.07853316,0.02790003,-0.012151465,-0.0040048133,0.003418532,-0.01494977,-0.032770712,-0.011333278,0.02836019,0.01152565,-0.05926966,0.033224326,-0.025472019,0.012132498,0.056393582,-0.0021094598,0.06934281,-0.11743632,-0.0093629295,0.032472715,-0.047528476,-0.054920096,-0.09919793,-0.027668571,-0.030456139,-0.036095113,-0.041069508,0.0042284206,0.08476681,0.024195155,0.03140261,0.01597493,-8.497661e-33,-0.11925626,0.07509528,0.013446444,0.1140874,0.034997005,-0.008210159,-0.03782591,-0.05554151,0.028936144,-0.10898755,0.06803973,-0.12992582,-0.04148635,-0.050100576,0.12666537,0.059114844,-0.068716876,0.018526789,-0.027418073,-0.0138584785,-0.054461006,0.0071558403,-0.008187828,0.021617556,-0.010722158,0.0024166026,0.018368501,-0.09271799,-0.052913394,-0.03241591,-0.03593736,0.035944328,-0.03697674,0.048049282,0.009857794,0.08979586,-0.0008599138,-0.05883995,0.03284868,0.020393075,0.06674255,0.09416026,0.021401133,0.003757184,-0.020697424,0.023188248,0.016619513,0.0041293884,0.03250083,0.055311404,0.0751436,0.071929604,-0.014840961,0.039192796,0.0061426223,-0.025496136,0.043461453,-0.0095251845,0.013701774,-0.00021952901,0.042874746,-0.05607981,-0.010079324,0.0033575855,-0.03680504,0.011905893,0.082639776,-0.03319959,0.014508764,0.017929075,0.062462606,-0.0038571893,0.015182143,-0.036443036,-0.025584823,-0.14762889,0.00036100767,0.013781758,-0.041165978,-0.011509549,0.07985529,0.007950872,0.06630317,0.020060645,0.006488548,0.114283435,0.034337744,-0.025971498,0.04516649,0.00827491,0.027367506,-0.0149059575,-0.089625925,0.09841796,0.045757137,-5.6078846e-08,-0.04285256,-0.009695121,-0.00022746933,-0.075729355,0.0069364975,-0.10641583,0.0722554,0.1376577,0.061795875,0.010039723,0.08548912,-0.042380024,-0.02952499,-0.034959044,0.07811703,0.020751692,0.058524698,0.012617688,0.020748625,0.012269999,-0.03191218,0.03637361,-0.051395446,0.026319586,0.0953526,0.013464357,0.022806112,0.11756853,0.112123325,-0.032728273,-0.01926897,0.0035555523,-0.00369848,-0.0036836353,0.0100389365,0.07296851,0.06962581,-0.009068431,-0.06625448,0.06268733,-0.057459358,0.11686243,-0.010691891,-0.008401645,0.004089127,0.036463715,-0.0025801323,-0.015327672,-0.0126525415,0.04792853,-0.024474798,0.00080414995,-0.007465444,0.050387014,-0.02664144,-0.0407116,-0.024082871,0.034819014,0.081138864,0.017293762,-0.018769056,-0.06278376,-0.075812116,-0.07190423,2,15.482994,15.111442,11
547,"we first did a comparative study
 between features and r-squared where we want to reduce the number of features because of the difficulty presented by dimensionality.
principal component analysis (pca) uses singular value decomposition (svd). in a data set with variables x1 and x2, it is feasible to obtain as many principal components (pcs) as the number of dimensions, i.e., pc_1 and pc_2, which are orthogonal to each other. the direction of these principal component axes is so oriented that the first component explains the maximum variability, and the next components explain successively less variability. at first, this is a two-dimensional problem, and pca successfully simplifies it into one dimension.  pca reduces the dimension of the data set. it is necessary to calculate the variance inflation factor (vif) before pca is applied. while principal components increase predictive power, their interpretability is severely compromised. ""what-if"" analyses are not possible with principal components since they are not real features but mathematical entities used for prediction. therefore, tracing predictions back to the original variables is compromised when pca is used.
pca is also used in exploratory data analysis (eda), which dictates the choice between going for ordinary regression or pca regression.
limitations of pca are its interpretative difficulties. but one strong point is that it can be used to visualize large datasets because the original data, which might have many dimensions (columns), can be reduced very much using the corresponding principal components.
another well-known dimensionality reduction method is t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-sne), which compares t-distribution with gaussian normal distribution. t-sne is a probabilistic method.
the process of converting raw data to labeled data through t-sne is achieved by developing a probability distribution for every data point that reflects its closeness to all other points in the

557," in today's class, we continued the discussion of vif, in which we saw that if a feature's vif value is high, then that feature is highly dependent on other features. vif is used for determining multicollinearity. in vif analysis, we set up a threshold, any feature having vif above it can be removed. then we move onto principal component analysis(pca), in which we plot vif against r^2. we see that the principal components are orthogonal to each other. as the number of principal components increases, the number of dimensions in the data also increases. pc are the axis which captures the best variance in the data. the function y=f(x) can be interpreted as y=f(pc) and it has mainly two uses, for prediction and answering what-if type questions. pc analysis can be used for data reduction, dimension reduction, in prediction models, and visualization in eda to understand the structure of data. pca is sensitive to data scale and hence we need to normalize the data. we saw two

562,"we started the lecture where we left off last time, discussing about the vif values and the iterative procedure of finding the most independent features. we understood that the threshold value chosen should have some justification. we then moved on to pca i.e. principal component analysis. we discussed that pca helps us to reduce the dimensionality of our problem, by somewhat changing the axes of our data such that each axis helps to describe the maximum variance in the data. thus pc1 axes captures maximum variance, pc2 captures the next maximum variance and so on. a simple example could be a two dimensional linear data, which could be reduced to one dimension by taking the axis along the line. we need to check how many principal components we need in order to explain majority of the variance of the data. each principal component is a linear combination of each of the original features. the coefficient of each feature in the linear combination, is known as loadings. now in between pca and vif, the vif procedure should be done first as it eliminates multicolinearity which is a bigger issue. also, pca hinders with our interpretability as the features are not what they actually meant, but a combination of multiple features. however, pca does help us in dimension reduction, for making good predictions and also in visualisation and understanding the structure of the data. when used for visualisation, pca becomes a part of eda. pca requires normalisation of the data. if pc1 and pc2 cover 70 to 80 percent of the variance of the data, then the multidimensional data can be visualised in two dimensions by plotting the data on a pc1 vs pc2 plot. now for better visualisation, we have another tool called tsne. tsne is a lossy transformation which helps us to visualise our data in two dimensions. it is based on the t-distribution and also uses gradient descent, and is hence slow and not consistent. tsne calculates a probability distribution of all the other points being close to one certain point. it does this for each and every point. this data is taken into a matrix and then the dimension is reduced. tsne means t-distributed stochastic neighbour encoding. t-distribution helps us to magnify the difference between the points if there exists any, and thus helps in classification and clustering.

575,"the session highlighted the use of principal component analysis (pca) in feature reduction, focusing on dimensionality reduction while retaining the most variance. a brief introduction was provided on the need to remove correlated factors using vif before pca can be performed. the applications of pca included visualization (eda), embedding in prediction models, and analysis of the structure of data as a comparison between classic regression models and pc regression, improved interpretability, and computational efficiency. this includes how to extract the pcs and how to determine the number of pcs by the elbow method. then, the session efficiently packs out with the role of pca in the analysis of real-world data and predictive modeling

580,"today in class we got into principal component analysis. it's advantages and disadvantages. it greatly reduces the dimensionality of the data sets given. we had two things pc1 and pc2. first captures maximum variance in the data and 2nd one next max variance. then we also discussed about vif, it removes multi collinearity in the data. also we again got to know the importance of eda and it's really great even if we are giving 80% time cleaning the data.",-0.018500874,-0.024428913,0.011703233,-0.056374494,0.022896012,0.018871991,-0.040307116,0.0020808836,0.028407186,0.047134675,-0.0027737923,0.077795394,-0.09665622,0.025427075,-0.03318257,-0.009179953,0.0560471,0.0491702,-0.04865768,0.027830899,-0.040941846,-0.011997424,-0.062131338,0.013218882,-0.0027918702,0.09986931,0.053900518,0.019727144,-0.015078114,-0.03829324,0.03453296,0.044109628,0.028688133,-0.02142938,-0.06227937,0.02099408,0.061530504,0.072966434,-0.08309447,-0.0026904093,0.018031335,0.064681426,-0.00025080948,0.014793894,0.07945802,-0.041761708,-0.060193732,-0.14547928,0.059233773,-0.059110586,0.022573275,-0.032842558,-0.021859672,-0.0033279145,-0.041928064,-0.017657898,0.025064152,-0.07823595,-0.019239979,0.013665808,0.012266248,0.019569395,0.051167343,0.0028940896,0.07860938,-0.035923734,0.008470382,-0.035157334,-0.0060706115,0.012873967,-0.08949357,0.004324344,-0.036959134,0.028989162,0.021830177,0.04278287,-0.089958444,-0.040159453,0.103228115,-0.041538153,0.086567655,0.0954295,-0.016038362,0.01807866,0.0119209485,-0.0068876627,-0.016294941,-0.11074207,-0.011657868,-0.077688836,0.14821588,0.07492996,0.14738803,0.022031996,0.0118175475,-0.03821968,0.011516121,-0.070396364,0.033034697,0.006498527,-0.002552862,-0.0033899676,-0.024712639,0.044514406,-0.09419189,-0.10377535,0.0068417485,-0.0011466718,0.018822746,-0.023972355,-0.013722783,0.023326227,-0.05982975,-0.009444471,0.04752724,-0.015309216,0.0042771,0.063846156,0.07611409,0.0072916774,-0.05272628,-0.12851983,0.039592948,0.039159007,0.05337734,-0.020921122,-0.077193126,2.6171487e-33,0.009780492,0.012110792,-0.04978423,0.0074071507,-0.029933782,-0.023421817,0.04880112,-0.061124776,0.06736989,0.02428036,-0.039720234,0.07701676,0.039495625,0.10753186,0.022020603,0.0023010832,0.033523552,0.06337621,0.02550092,-0.04003994,0.0742435,-0.04257142,0.13259524,-0.028488586,0.012742782,-0.078168474,-0.03562068,-0.022703055,0.012287957,-0.023926111,-0.037653834,-0.04007528,-0.064453125,0.11098734,0.005140036,-0.039809275,0.025018439,-0.049048074,0.09616981,0.026084023,0.029076228,0.059898183,0.06758212,-0.09883597,-0.018488528,0.06892166,-0.0045688953,0.026674686,-0.020188088,-0.0035890099,0.020952817,0.031671666,-0.008460029,0.0036999842,-0.063484415,0.05974452,0.045719326,-0.09705029,-0.0123951975,-0.047755726,-0.09742956,0.034345657,-0.009313661,-0.06164005,-0.05465372,-0.062276624,-0.009935206,-0.024512036,0.03092641,-0.00036317605,-0.038012583,-0.022283785,-0.060296446,-0.08645052,0.042432744,-0.07590445,-0.07223807,0.09955386,0.003951587,0.05901874,-0.08020186,0.044674955,0.005272957,-0.052792326,0.04276579,-0.07355823,0.0280039,-0.076067075,0.0116872415,-0.024341732,0.0047322707,0.0798866,0.051480033,0.039707072,0.07785272,-2.0021578e-33,-0.059078913,0.046196505,0.0033856658,0.061967123,0.03665522,-0.039649412,-0.03427174,-0.06859102,0.011249804,-0.04222656,0.074584745,-0.009662377,0.023018893,-0.039111394,0.062911645,0.032861095,0.0020936246,-0.023007553,-0.010711876,-0.08605105,0.031530377,-0.06787326,0.0136895,-0.04584804,0.007409204,-0.054466497,-0.02948325,-0.09310165,-0.025460115,-0.022558901,-0.013044634,0.074495055,-0.03856998,0.068916164,-0.039674275,-0.00902011,-0.019408027,-0.06474244,0.0051223184,0.046993714,0.008448358,0.07581944,0.073243074,0.0041709193,-0.026049864,-0.0016959236,0.047564995,0.13841592,-0.007706221,0.024486646,0.0131527465,0.045115735,0.038741764,-0.008608163,0.064577945,0.0070904642,0.1106599,0.0035013314,-0.0047724224,0.029312924,0.08986674,0.047001824,-0.09173543,0.063587315,-0.012689798,0.06211768,0.06137678,-0.009031499,-0.00994569,-0.05427291,0.06841679,-0.00054355984,0.012497688,-0.015611724,-0.06760396,-0.045736883,-0.013321837,0.017037477,0.06319745,0.036466923,-0.009433774,-0.052081358,0.0013918665,-0.007069746,-0.027976768,0.062571816,0.035997212,-0.07934858,-0.021388007,-0.022588631,-0.021045238,-0.04538915,0.006464896,0.042112455,0.077040605,-4.2336673e-08,-0.052857608,-0.07910689,-0.0048555676,-0.108301714,-0.014206456,-0.14546435,-0.030468741,0.1609868,0.041252892,0.034686573,0.08822848,-0.014868908,-0.09243802,0.018543815,0.08167044,0.053675078,0.08359826,0.06721198,-0.033628903,0.024542475,0.048389364,-0.011588116,-0.004169564,-0.035441063,0.0235879,0.012131758,0.08871931,0.07944084,0.06104067,-0.0056102863,-0.0183099,-0.008141094,0.012414357,-0.026346771,0.04785498,0.029270517,0.046239607,-0.020625426,-0.04654656,0.008377333,-0.059292063,-0.020819487,-0.010537407,-0.031047588,0.031246336,0.05825843,0.010188654,0.013879021,0.030970702,-0.0011699003,-0.06316842,-0.016306356,0.015755432,0.0066454816,-0.0033789645,0.030044917,0.014969593,0.037503034,0.03169021,-0.016017504,-0.00042094904,-0.015953697,-0.063604906,-0.05381597,2,19.311272,16.45694,11
592,"we continued with the correlation problems. we observed the heat maps for perfectly co-related data and partially correlated data. heatmaps are more coherent if they are created after sorting the data. when we calculate vif, we do not process the values of y but only x-values. vif is simply the function of x. f(x(i != j)). in this method, we progressively eliminate the features based on threshold vif. we have to decide on the threshold value of r^2 because we only choose the vif values below the threshold. we have to check if the feature being eliminated is important for the data or not. if it is important, we can't just eliminate it. 
lesson: don't do think mechanically. 
principal component analysis: principal components are necessarily orthogonal to each other. number of principal components is equal number of dimensions of the data. out of these principal components, we have to decide which among these are important. pc1 is the axis that captures the best variance in the data, pc2 is the second best axis to capture variance. pca actually helps us to reduce the dimensionality of the data. we plot the fraction of variance for these components. these plots are called elbow plot. each principal component is a mixture of features multiplied by loading. but do not blindly follow the process. first check if the dimensionality should need to be reduced or not. in general vif needs to be done first, because inter-collinearity is a big problem. 
after pca, instead of representing y as a function of x, we represent it in the form of function of pca. after representing we do what-if analysis on the function. we later explain the results however with pca we lose explainability. we can't do any sensitive analyses. vif reduced the number of features in real space. and if we still have many methods, we can go for pca. 
pca helps in dimension reduction, helps predicting model, helps in visualization of data. when pca is used for visualization, which comes under eda. pca pre-supposes normalization in the data. we need to normalize the data before using pca. we then tried these method on the data from midsem and noticed that out of 24, 18 features were needed to explain the data. pca is a lossless method, data is not lost. 
we started with t-sne (t-distributed stochastic neighbor encoding). t stands for t-distribution. probability wise, t-distribution predicts more probability for wide spread data; gaussian on the other hand is tighter. it is stochastic in nature and gradient descent is involved in the process, hence while running itâ€™s code, it is likely to take time. here we lose the exactness of data but gain the closeness of data. we can map multi-dimensional data onto lower dimensional data. we usually do not prefer to plot beyond 3 dimensions.

611,"vif vs r-square
features vs r-square trade-off 
our goal is to reduce the number of features because of the curse of dimensionality. 
pca: an application of svd (singular value decomposition). if we have a data set like x1 vs x2. we can have as many pcs as the dimensions, pc1 and pc2, ensuring they are orthogonal. the orientation of these pc axes is such that the 1st one accounts for the maximum variability and then less as we follow. orginally, this problem is a 2-dimensional problem which has been reduced to 1 dimension through pca!
pca helps us to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. vif (needs to be done first) vs pca 
interpretability: pcs help with prediction but their interpretability is very low. we can't perform what if analysis with pcs as they are not even real features, they are just mathematical features used for predictability. we can't link predictions with original variables if we use pca.
pca analysis is used for (1) dimension reduction (2) prediction model (3) visualization (understanding the structure of data) 
pca is a part of eda. then we select if we have to go for normal regression vs pca regression.
disadvantages of pca
advantage: if we have very big data, we can visualize it using pca. original data had many dimensions (columns) which can be significantly compressed using relevant pcs
another important dimensionality reduction method is tsne; t distribution vs gaussian normal distribution; tsne is a probabilistic method.
raw data to labelled data using tsne. tsne creates a probability distribution for each point that tells us the closeness of that point with every other point in the dataset. in higher dimensions, we

640,"we started a new topic vif which is used to determine the most important and unique parameters. in vif vs r squared graph, we fix a vif threshold corresponding to r squared = 0.9 and reject the parameters having vif greater than the threshold value. we start eliminating features one by one such that there are no features with vif greater than say 10. our motivation for reducing the features is to minimize the curse of dimensionality. we then looked at principal component analysis which is an application of single value decomposition. it also works similar to vif by reducing dimensionality. the remaining components are known as principal components. principal components are always orthogonal to each other. the essential difference vif and pca are the parameters which they test. we generally perform vif first as it increases the interpretability. vif is useful for making predictions and pca is more useful for ""what if"" analysis or delta analysis. the uses of pca include dimension reduction, making prediction model and visualisation which is done in eda stage. the thing to be cautious about is the scale dependency of pca and some parameters might need normalisation. we then concluded the lecture with discussion on tsne.

662,"today's session discussed variance inflation factor (vif) and principal component analysis (pca) in-depth.

we first discussed vif, a statistical factor to check for multicollinearity among independent variables in regression models. we understood that high vif suggests high correlation between independent variables, which tends to bias the coefficient estimates and decrease model interpretability. the session discussed vif, its interpretation, and how to deal with multicollinearity. the method consists of removing features individually, beginning from the largest vif, so that all remaining features have a vif value less than an arbitrarily selected value. this both reduces the curse of dimensionality and enhances the performance of the model. we also saw that vif scores would tend to form an elbow-like pattern upon plotting, from which a threshold can be conveniently determined.

then, we discussed pca, which is an unsupervised method of reducing dimension with retaining the maximum variance in the data. pca is dependent on singular value decomposition (svd) and assists in transforming data to a new set of uncorrelated principal components. principal components are orthogonal to one another, thus ensuring that multicollinearity is removed. we also observed how pca has the capability of dimension reduction from higher dimensions to lower dimensions, as in the example where data was reduced from two dimensions to one.

a major difference between vif and pca was explored. vif is usually performed first to provide better interpretability because it maintains the original features, which would make prediction simpler to interpret. pca, however, converts features into principal components, so it is better used for ""what-if"" analysis or delta analysis than for explicit prediction.

the session also touched on various applications of pca, such as dimensionality reduction, predictive modeling, and visualization (particularly in exploratory data analysis - eda). but we observed that pca is scale-dependent, and thus normalization becomes an essential preprocessing step.

near the conclusion, t-sne (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) was introduced as yet another dimension reduction method. it was briefly mentioned how a gaussian and t-distribution comparison on the same dataset highlighted differences between them in picking up data variance.

the session, in summary, illustrated how vif and pca assist with multicollinearity and dimension reduction, ensuring machine learning models are interpretable and effective.",0.003125797,-0.05073707,-0.013940682,0.012838768,0.09817267,0.054096602,-0.024488628,-0.030585997,0.07943997,0.016080685,-0.015029511,0.04503857,-0.096000284,0.0642233,-0.008255367,-0.033146407,0.044348735,0.029378153,-0.094943255,-0.0047822413,0.012915534,-0.03321956,-0.049338825,0.037483916,0.05563723,0.0010829042,-0.021503571,-0.0020030483,-0.05110818,0.011397777,-8.961059e-05,0.09924638,0.008241901,-0.052715447,-0.004250858,0.03644968,0.061082687,0.07886249,-0.09911223,-0.005615438,-0.00965791,-0.023420582,0.016097102,0.06078749,0.123137824,-0.0034884731,-0.02367276,-0.08135138,0.017759291,0.0015444864,-0.008643238,0.016680676,-0.044852704,0.05887628,-0.05418741,-0.012155914,-0.03092621,-0.038083766,0.063630186,0.0001572155,-0.07099057,0.027123524,0.033870257,0.0140311755,0.105446726,0.009879498,-0.021266092,-0.031142531,-0.09334184,0.08177629,-0.05799734,0.037946276,-0.036923997,-0.015708204,0.034413375,0.0608346,-0.042895343,-0.05930145,0.090967655,0.029965062,0.040246766,0.12504,0.007974326,-0.023507651,0.016974969,-0.036684845,0.036481827,-0.08348822,-0.015271098,0.06485676,0.028754776,0.029447027,0.038380697,0.022626506,-0.02136508,0.010927857,0.026580444,-0.08806922,0.032101844,0.06666247,-0.008305722,-0.031047734,0.051666137,0.040717803,-0.021885743,-0.07508804,0.009512482,0.03220938,0.036915086,-0.021253852,-0.052050382,0.037488207,-0.046214405,0.021317173,0.053072616,0.041387226,0.026902093,0.04912137,0.057187308,0.054267358,0.009028344,-0.024409216,0.07949373,0.08559444,0.045267623,0.07319785,-0.07591742,6.910802e-33,0.02928431,0.055959065,0.012945765,-0.02141967,-0.01836075,-0.004499248,-0.018590959,-0.03363607,0.051911417,0.075544834,-0.049475294,0.049375687,0.00031022629,0.08234124,0.028806236,0.007394387,-0.008654131,0.044491462,-0.006373748,-0.029460985,0.055230264,-0.052581247,0.022601679,-0.029368483,-0.04962931,-0.054071937,-0.059772417,-0.009637887,-0.08117255,0.00817061,-0.09081364,0.046094052,-0.005778932,0.014919908,-0.06371724,-0.0625462,-0.021469876,-0.06300821,0.12213977,0.029017916,0.010917105,-0.013803137,0.013063346,-0.04539982,-0.04423643,0.039186187,0.058759253,-0.04300104,-0.09628117,-0.0015460761,0.0026412357,0.04463947,0.008825877,-0.033714734,-0.123112,0.060102586,-0.0027268182,-0.12388545,-0.04116801,-0.04530273,-0.09711176,0.06378001,-0.038259886,-0.041339807,-0.06347233,-0.06775043,-0.0055446364,0.0110154115,0.018472973,0.0053193667,-0.06699587,-0.011007663,-0.002517192,-0.100802384,-0.0020995755,0.015798265,0.030660935,0.023567846,0.04885698,-0.06950743,-0.059268914,0.044329513,0.0526813,-0.10133992,0.029049383,-0.08101614,0.006409368,-0.11549235,-0.033639234,-0.10408268,-0.016151085,0.05131898,0.07881745,-0.0670563,0.020737085,-7.2606326e-33,-0.038889546,0.012097387,-0.013389653,0.03645498,0.007961794,-0.06399523,-0.009102927,-0.018007575,-0.024007607,-0.13544306,0.038653612,-0.04718596,0.008515105,-0.0010142684,0.09705733,0.03757398,-0.023056142,0.004007242,-0.006724385,-0.035760734,0.0036918465,-0.024300177,-0.01361782,0.012868328,-0.062301572,-0.056367677,-0.026765268,-0.092799135,-0.07360094,0.012393567,-0.08493469,0.08807043,-0.04545846,0.02386614,0.026656967,-0.0037445074,-0.03767285,-0.10418963,-0.05188028,0.073176265,0.057632055,0.029469443,-0.05093885,0.015480453,-0.03406226,-0.003085756,0.050330903,0.10033911,0.057402883,0.033719968,-0.03368466,0.019516392,0.012483717,0.067315094,-0.027815547,-0.0097980155,0.068094395,-0.06331712,0.04508001,0.010691535,0.04112807,0.011747497,-0.06700668,-0.007424313,0.09171892,-0.042246345,0.03233228,-0.025188575,0.003583586,-0.027843,0.010177236,-0.07932232,0.008559104,-0.0060253995,-0.044131216,-0.05890927,0.008434573,-0.01807504,-0.012003358,0.014644044,0.020440297,-0.011488668,0.035674702,-0.03835615,-0.03601949,0.11653376,0.011314003,0.012708422,0.0011154298,-0.0025603669,-0.06167357,0.01038399,-0.04806947,0.055302233,0.03868545,-5.9338916e-08,-0.061435547,-0.00023577746,-0.06885295,-0.016697017,0.016143674,-0.06622829,0.03822137,0.13267379,0.02716654,0.05741921,0.12234401,-0.032210976,-0.081472,0.016670462,0.03362885,0.052545838,0.024752343,0.118605524,-0.045315173,0.0146006225,0.044468038,0.038335104,-0.0398098,-0.066645905,0.070102505,-0.090574205,0.0057059545,0.14063051,0.057633135,0.048211686,-0.010704312,0.012918576,-0.020789525,-0.004625441,0.02037818,0.096335255,0.06399547,0.0021104817,-0.030066486,0.055866048,-0.04804533,0.062458128,-0.06252175,0.0038278084,0.03391678,0.04331829,0.023398077,-0.030890606,0.016717855,-0.014861322,-0.044443958,-0.014179025,-0.005243999,0.11658827,0.053670637,0.021956736,-0.030370174,0.10632753,-0.03436471,-0.04727767,0.041832995,-0.074176446,-0.032743458,-0.0579532,2,16.009724,16.915745,11
