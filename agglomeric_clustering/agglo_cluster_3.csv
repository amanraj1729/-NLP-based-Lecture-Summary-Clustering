34,"in the equation ""y=f(x)"" , before ml f was deduced by manually by plotting data points and curve fitting. ml uses various algorithms such as slr, mlr, logistic regression , random forest , k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering out of which the last two come under unsupervised learning methods while the prior 4 are supervised learning techniques. topics of statistics were discussed upon . the different levels of measurement which are :-
i)nominal_(discrete): such as gender , color classifications into different categories.
ii)ordinal_(discrete): such as grades , unlike nominal these can be ordered.(classification)
iii)interval_(continuous): such as temperature, pressure references are arbitrary.(regression)
iv)ratio_(continuous): height, weight , salary zero is fixed.(regression)
in the equation ""y=f(x)"", y is known label and x is known as features .
when both of them are available supervised learning methods are used .
when we don't have labels unsupervised learning methods are used.
population and sample(small but representative part of the population) were discussed upon too.",-0.0039720545,-0.026724888,0.0086819725,0.08008739,0.07919473,0.015952775,-0.053595196,-0.027157666,0.0157178,0.036229078,0.07128477,-0.054057892,-0.031282697,0.027731473,0.0062476373,-0.060443543,0.027213264,0.0019936268,-0.08168845,-0.032639787,0.04096629,-0.0027984653,0.010925808,0.065498054,0.024538558,-0.026520187,-0.02443186,0.068023965,-0.017824588,0.020376567,-0.009170229,0.054118693,0.066213,0.00087211974,-0.10324331,-0.07683584,0.075927615,0.05470614,-0.06456941,0.07140228,-0.065590166,-0.08591976,0.030257761,0.0006588889,0.057603143,0.07955751,-0.021978896,-0.04317962,-0.09815053,0.07965322,-0.0021143071,0.053736277,-0.066945866,0.07353588,0.034143366,0.042016182,0.03220767,-0.10403283,0.011421876,0.077951,-0.099579915,0.0058902716,-0.08652255,0.031524245,0.046187468,0.045617513,-0.04842053,-0.011377183,0.04108454,0.032611717,0.057621643,0.051381093,0.009985817,-0.002735748,0.03537844,-0.03902223,0.025205376,0.052282143,0.03828406,-0.008298475,0.014074639,0.08160878,-0.01687405,0.003673371,0.051619314,-0.022157313,0.012379181,0.010643544,-0.06192738,0.030949077,0.052621704,0.025118748,-0.1060687,0.06999615,-0.052427746,-0.0565778,0.026899733,-0.050530083,0.08299523,0.026166217,-0.070468254,0.018238561,0.013877114,0.02425191,-0.0097964285,-0.06379636,-0.0023595393,0.028149283,0.09480978,0.018104253,-0.07171109,-0.02611536,-0.10514161,0.032038238,0.0014658954,-0.06731014,0.049335524,-0.023745744,-0.065900095,0.004828569,-0.010036003,0.03436296,0.022225603,0.05576291,0.023610035,-0.009291679,-0.07490083,9.735529e-33,-0.02504963,-0.09032612,-0.0005877291,-0.020949913,-0.030472232,-0.03566489,-0.061465364,-0.003032129,0.1165807,0.07725517,-0.021581262,0.077715695,-0.034082346,0.04524226,0.053617675,-0.004314839,0.07190569,0.10050731,-0.055285163,0.0113721825,-0.0109303435,0.008180393,0.033798657,-0.035092182,0.009887509,0.0707333,-0.0039561237,0.045492165,-0.006366429,-0.0007873787,-0.008754649,-0.022552587,-0.030884793,-0.04381574,-0.03479631,-0.05912295,0.05204238,-0.0251967,-0.014663922,-0.0046685045,-0.013260504,-0.02906657,0.12095056,-0.081564866,0.0262942,0.055435143,-0.0029510106,-0.027951483,-0.024972351,0.05366943,-0.09545851,-0.07500725,0.038095262,-0.07221685,-0.027668238,0.08201788,-0.04720947,-0.023273699,-0.11792129,-0.012480021,-0.08741359,-0.012764942,0.031954728,-0.04159298,0.030131903,0.025563838,0.023000468,-0.033876356,0.069632724,4.852659e-05,-0.0089299185,0.049604915,-0.03418215,0.021305427,0.05412031,0.04846363,-0.022459798,-0.01198855,0.01602829,0.036944292,-0.043880455,0.022573024,-0.049075373,-0.051627547,-0.002388696,-0.0033508975,0.02581944,-0.01633085,0.060501628,-0.04282402,-0.16258128,0.009634998,-0.0711014,0.038817707,0.02787293,-1.0974809e-32,-0.07422916,0.07646595,-0.040223707,0.021001192,-0.04333496,0.049395625,-0.010694199,0.0077701095,0.048710134,-0.053756136,-0.053468153,-0.027495654,0.01442433,0.025753591,0.024688942,0.09158876,-0.11459513,-0.04626886,-0.08772075,0.05163074,-0.050904073,0.09157935,-0.07958541,-0.027834764,-0.026794802,-0.003963571,-0.052620444,0.0728368,-0.048987243,-0.017749917,-0.028446957,-0.068567045,-0.017536469,-0.10191214,-0.030940369,-0.048655704,0.007845938,-0.048706964,-0.050729606,0.041963656,0.045397837,0.0671806,0.026462443,-0.10143528,-0.010770798,-0.088652216,0.11132586,-0.023644429,0.031217068,0.0017826427,-0.009111025,0.0021273838,-0.041740216,0.038522914,-0.090735674,-0.007289943,-0.045298837,-0.04904519,-0.062144466,0.051361136,0.07725075,-0.062181436,-0.006184872,0.07568188,-0.04546109,-0.045757417,0.038647223,0.019990133,-0.02561299,-0.058831923,-0.014835886,-0.015152296,0.07666507,-0.022975365,-0.020071002,-0.090306714,-0.03457906,0.013380299,-0.041142106,0.0137668,0.045103446,-0.06348955,-0.0053306543,0.096969195,-0.010962349,-0.033036016,0.101925045,0.017424425,0.047953445,-0.10380485,-0.018297369,0.048786342,-0.09407956,0.08071338,-0.06351008,-7.359158e-08,-0.069228016,0.013316251,0.032503072,0.005586135,0.04870297,0.022722114,-0.036721952,0.055653803,-0.05989999,0.035260018,0.035751164,0.07101557,-0.077782094,-0.036709767,-0.019006835,-0.004847119,0.07145352,0.06642768,-0.011315829,-0.012108888,0.052743133,-0.061972238,-0.04734102,0.007168589,0.0698453,-0.08133423,0.035190802,0.08812344,0.019754032,0.102031074,-0.047133677,0.033957146,0.025045991,-0.027170444,0.052764338,0.074418865,0.038920555,-0.043567706,-0.034772206,-0.0066810595,-0.032473695,0.008924457,-0.077819884,-0.0032796944,0.114037365,0.020128917,-0.0066309506,0.016361892,0.0063845743,0.03249745,-0.028473143,0.04211605,0.014591299,0.06391253,0.048643354,0.025220426,-0.032606043,-0.018040001,-0.027194096,0.0343073,0.094640106,-0.038567156,-0.0023790665,-0.014812801,3,23.956665,-12.577469,3
37,"i learned about four levels of measurement of statistics: nominal,ordinal,interval and ratio. i understood about supervised and unsupervised learning. the difference between population and sample is clear after the session. also the data we have captured till now is nothing compared to population. to handle such large data, we need more computational power. we should also look upon whether our model is good or not. testing is really important. i also got to know about one hot encoding (ohe) which is used because we can't just assign a number to nominal data as it by default assumes an

46,"so today we started off with the basics of data science, where we discussed that y = f(x) is basically the crux of data science, where we try to find different unknowns based on the data given to us. y is known as labels, while x is known as features (plural as it can be represented as a vector i.e. a collection of multiple entities). we discussed that the main motive of ml is to fit the most appropriate curve which can depict the given observational data, and unlike human calculations, which will lead us to some mathematical equations, the output of ml algorithms is an empirical equation. we talked about 4 algorithms i.e. simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, random forest and logistic regression. 
then we moved on to discuss the levels of measurement. there are 4 levels:
i) nominal - no ordering, only classification is possible. differentiation based on some characteristics, discrete. eg. gender, colour
ii) ordinal - inherent order between different groups. discrete. eg. grades
iii) interval - only the difference between entries matters, reference is arbitrary. continuous. eg. temperature
iv) ratio - reference is well defined. continuous. eg. height, weight

we also discussed the appropriate way of encoding data for using the algorithms. we should not use numbers directly as that may change our level of measurement from nominal to ordinal. instead we should use as many variables as there are categories, and use one hot encoding to create a vector, where each bit represents a particular character. 
we also suggested that nominal and ordinal level data can be classified into different groups, whereas interval and ratio level data can use regression to find relations between different observations. 
finally, we started with unsupervised learning, which is the branch of ml which deals with data where we do not have labels y, and we basically need to form clusters or groups based on some characteristic of the data points. there are 2 main classification algorithms, k - means clustering and hierarchial clustering.

57,"ds 203 15 january, 2025 (3rd lecture)
sir started by talking about y = f(x). he first talked about old and new methods of data analysis. for this he took the example of finding the temperature difference between the two ends of a pipe using the flow rate of the fluid flowing inside the pipe. y was the temperature difference denoted by delta-t and x was the flow rate.
in the old methods we used to get the equation relating y = f(x) like dt = l23, while in the new methods we get data points and obtain a plot of the curve which relates temperature difference with the corresponding flow rate.
then he talked about the methods that we use for obtaining the plot which are:
1.	slr â€“ simple linear regression
2.	mlr â€“ multiple linear regression
3.	logistic regression
4.	random forest
he also mentioned k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering.
then he said that there are two paths which are machine-learning and the other one is statistics, in this course we would frequently move from one path to another to get the assigned task done.
he then started talking about levels of measurement. there are four levels of measurement:
1.	nominal (discrete): for example, gender, color, etc. 
to explain, in this if two people have different gender no one is superior the other, all of them are equal.
2.	ordinal (discrete): for example, grades
but now how would the computer identify these (here, gender) as distinct because we need to associate some number with each grade for the computer to recognize them.
but if we assign numbers like male -1, female-2 and so on then we are doing something that is fundamentally wrong because we are attaching higher value to one of the them whereas, they should be equal.
in order to take care of this issue we use vectors and use them as a switch. it would be difficult to show that it here but sir has drawn that very nicely in his notes (uploaded on moodle).
example: dog [1 0 0 0]
3.	interval (continuous) for example, temperature
sir said that scale on which we are measuring will not create any issues.
4.	ratio (continuous) for example, height, weight, salary
y is known as label and x is known as feature.
supervised and unsupervised learning problems
a problem in which we know both the values of the label and the features is known as supervised learning problem.

then sir defined a function 
monthly-purchases = f (salary, month of year, size of family, etc.)
then he talked about the ml categories about each of the level of measurement: 
nominal â€“ classification
ordinal â€“ classification
interval â€“ regression
ratio â€“ regression
then he talked about unsupervised learning in which we donâ€™t know the value of labels associated with features.
there is hierarchical and k-means clustering. then he explained clustering by using a graph between features.
it is difficult to explain the flow chart (on page 9) in sirâ€™s notes but it is quite clear by looking at the flow chart.

we take a representative sample out of the population in order to save time and money for data analysis.
larger the value of the population more accurate is the prediction.",-0.026052998,-0.05393621,-0.008083809,0.03556411,0.08193275,-0.05538746,-0.020404873,0.034737315,0.0858287,0.06516942,0.034648817,0.000689109,-0.027138056,0.04630068,0.03026011,-0.025742846,-0.051119734,0.0030484174,-0.053846117,-0.060444284,0.07474078,-0.05541313,-0.040317044,0.05831041,0.023328692,-0.045216255,-0.065558985,0.0037940482,-0.03511033,0.04871338,-0.039648004,0.09032324,0.000740904,0.03537517,-0.074151866,-0.04091551,0.10138685,0.08843321,-0.07103628,0.054993466,-0.036861856,-0.0809078,0.08649399,-0.017802106,0.038725425,0.040541817,-0.109145366,-0.07353018,-0.122890465,0.03700726,-0.033540264,-0.0020117366,-0.0767688,0.04610274,0.027354456,0.016547225,0.057012904,-0.027752446,0.007480026,0.06655653,-0.014574849,0.0006071219,-0.09384648,0.027896713,0.06931961,-0.047094923,-0.022067863,0.05044855,0.014656937,-0.0018688298,-0.019269286,-0.008401082,0.016217127,-0.059134018,0.021529019,-0.087963454,0.055387627,0.104005046,-0.033500306,-0.07489206,0.039486807,0.069730185,0.014712751,0.0020735024,-0.10302575,0.014981461,-0.0084049525,-0.053383306,-0.0044680256,0.0031886352,0.027839657,0.031191802,-0.11611843,0.05383267,0.029185034,-0.0058991145,-0.027748201,0.016540665,0.14942454,4.3531174e-05,-0.06004661,-0.022663573,0.039291453,0.017155841,0.010519716,-0.018410625,-5.407101e-05,-0.018903397,0.050660953,0.024130816,-0.10225155,-0.0070273867,-0.08649441,0.074682266,0.065944776,-0.09868619,-0.016272979,-0.01464068,-0.021066008,0.033289105,0.01223441,0.0092188595,-0.03710129,0.043405596,0.06507235,-0.006452417,-0.0023348148,4.7546833e-33,0.0568419,-0.026545644,0.015103381,-0.011919169,0.04614219,-0.052797195,-0.07213309,-0.021971833,0.10569235,0.06588909,-0.066849515,0.063038595,-0.005183831,0.00034567455,0.04658356,0.00087721524,-0.018651923,0.013101129,0.0075831814,-0.02263116,0.043663632,0.0072663957,0.03094752,-0.025499692,-7.011841e-05,0.009714775,0.024562875,0.043835614,-0.029874213,0.035574116,-0.04976095,0.0059213648,-0.092101954,-0.011937467,-0.01305866,-0.039605554,0.06629986,-0.055407528,-0.010715762,0.019121666,-0.0151359625,-0.03853643,0.065193206,-0.040140186,-0.017048307,0.0753074,-0.09200677,0.022364639,-0.014870218,0.056252126,-0.065300286,-0.05318669,0.056711983,-0.03195702,0.022447078,0.08139889,-0.05419742,-0.04618651,-0.031979874,0.050528478,-0.061999157,-0.019578138,-0.028287118,-0.053366523,0.006828987,0.062422235,0.013565747,-0.0031266636,0.056433648,-0.03957576,-0.093828276,0.04940232,-0.034408715,-0.04909909,0.07417721,-0.011623642,0.018028893,0.026572313,-0.038395368,-0.027001413,-0.12341581,0.030457629,-0.059411395,-0.045644026,0.009330483,-0.0038992758,0.015508526,-0.028572327,-0.010870782,-0.037529748,-0.12450061,0.022622721,-0.015834589,0.07427921,0.063802466,-7.272874e-33,-0.032822266,0.057959374,0.0071201962,0.099699974,0.009452555,0.04954245,0.014918143,-0.0011215056,0.110553056,-0.06126278,-0.06906513,-0.010455639,-0.0054327734,0.03372778,0.118692175,-0.011152104,-0.031609025,-0.056354843,-0.08299591,-0.004912718,-0.021774258,0.06438535,-0.07900899,-0.11383198,-0.042073794,-0.037735753,-0.033765387,0.015771974,-0.09922853,-0.038091853,-0.020882707,-0.025657702,-0.02007327,-0.053077694,-0.035177335,0.031876694,0.059377737,-0.037735708,-0.010784034,-0.062317666,0.027452305,-0.008051555,0.06770476,-0.13075103,-0.018590342,0.04476114,0.04138496,-0.014850554,0.03622245,0.007610717,0.033067327,-0.023575343,-0.015531642,0.0033056156,-0.07000131,0.03184592,-0.0037821978,-0.007584269,-0.122256376,0.0011797867,0.035857666,-0.07507793,-0.047304515,0.03513445,-0.044753995,-0.045689013,0.013088852,-0.065726765,0.033910125,0.022319285,-0.02416263,-0.00909227,0.035518464,0.0022709495,0.024301821,-0.09896851,-0.0685491,-0.05094282,-0.08683854,0.071687296,0.01421616,0.030725092,0.019294303,0.035561446,0.056129582,-0.09960797,0.040596798,0.018918041,0.049624838,-0.06966387,0.029864354,-0.017558044,-0.122563116,0.051956113,-0.0067685796,-6.816713e-08,-0.04050972,-0.011326765,0.0156048965,0.0034153406,0.078258395,0.06341671,-0.039624944,0.13521379,-0.017231105,0.056741066,0.07474254,0.14686759,-0.026264481,-0.013667082,-0.022179514,-0.031799473,0.06043977,0.021252371,0.008784532,-0.008206039,0.059015904,-0.04325304,-0.032042027,0.027794007,0.05404518,-0.04734551,0.0124885,0.049475867,-0.009020921,-0.0060243686,-0.071261145,0.065538585,0.03801022,0.063767634,0.0728341,0.036706485,0.039933562,0.05605756,0.021781566,0.0095011555,0.02147492,0.0031459124,-0.04022677,0.019349039,0.098028585,0.03517401,-0.00039117844,0.039252132,-0.023097036,0.011355101,0.00021420573,0.06718185,-0.04212143,0.08296986,0.036961783,-0.03740824,-0.0839266,-0.06530858,-0.022605646,0.044540033,0.00033570555,0.024115987,0.0007194544,-0.064859144,3,24.375883,-10.060035,3
84,we started the class by y=f(x). we have data of y and x. we use machine learning models to find f. next we discussed about levels of measurement. starting with nominal which would basically differentiate between a characteristic. examples are gender and colour. then ordinal which had an inherent order. then there were inherent like temperature and ratio like height and weight. when there is no label it becomes an unsupervised learning model. then we have to use segmentation algorithms and assign labels. we have to realise the fact that any data we analyse is a sample.

91,"in today's session, we saw that the equation y=f(x) shows that we can find the function by identifying the data pattern of y and x. then we move onto 4 levels of measurement which are as follows:
nominal: discrete data like gender or color, which we can just classify not measure.
ordinal: discrete data like grades, which have their inherent order, we can also classify them.
interval: continuous data like temperature, here the definition of 0 is arbitrary.
ratio: continuous data like height, in which you can state 10m is twice of 5m.
we saw that we should not associate numbers directly with nominal and ordinal data types, instead we can use vectors to represent them. in y=f(x), y is called the label and the x's are features. if we know both, then to predict f we use supervised learning methods like slr, mlr, etc. if we don't know the labels, we can predict f with unsupervised learning methods like hierarchical clustering, etc. in which we form clusters of x's, analyze each, and then convert them into labeled data.
if the label data is nominal or ordinal, we use classification and regression for interval and ratio data types. then we see that whatever the size of the data is, it is always a sample that we need to analyze to get y=f(x), and further that you should back-test your model before

115,"in todays lecture, the broad topics were
1. the core of machine learning i.e. y = f(x)
- the data available is visualised and the crux is techinques to predict a function as close to the original functions
2. introduction to levels of measurement (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio)
-nominal mainly represents equality i.e. equal or not equal.
-ordinal represents inequalities (<= or >=) with both being discrete
-interval represents a continuous data where reference i.e. 0 is not defined ex: temperature,   year
-ratio represents a continuous data type where a reference is defined i.e. ratio is defined.
3. machine learning algorithms of various data types (classifcation for nominal and ordinal data type, regression for interval and ratio data type)
-for classification, the ordinal data type is mainly encoded into one hot encodings based on number of classes.
4. what is supervised (label present or y is known while training), unsupervised (label is absent or y is unknown as the case with majority of real world data)

here, y is the label and x is the feature.
if both the labels and features are present then it is called â€œsupervised learningâ€. however if the data is raw and the labels are not present the it is called â€œunsupervised learningâ€.

137,"attributes: properties or features of data that describe its characteristics or dimensions. example : â€œheightâ€, â€œageâ€, â€œweightâ€ etc.

operations: actions or computations performed on attributes or data to analyze, transform or process them. example : mean, median, mode, add, subtract, multiply, divide.

parameter: describes the entire population, and estimated using statistic.

statistic: describes a sample from the population and is directly calculated from the sample data.

simple linear regression: y=ax+b
here, y is the dependent variable or label, also called as response variable, and x is the feature or the independent variable. 

bias: introduced in models to address or approximate the effects of variables not explicitly included in the model.
if the confidence is low then, the confidence interval shrinks while if the confidence is 100% then we get an infinite confidence interval. 
we estimate the unknown parameters a and b in y=ax+b using the idea of minimizing the sum of squares of errors. 

closed form solutions: an exact and explicit mathematical expression that solves a given problem or equation in terms of known functions and constants. 

using the method of minimizing the sum of squares of errors, we get the closed form solution for the simple regression model for single predictor. however these are point estimates and we need to arrive at the possible interval in which these values lie such that there is higher chance that the population parameters lie within the intervals.

154," topics introduced:
1. empirical equation:
   - general form: y= beta_0 + beta_1 * l 
   - briefly explained as a basis for understanding simple linear relationships.

2. statistical and machine learning models:
   -slr (simple linear regression): explained as a method to model relationships between a dependent variable and one independent variable.
   -mlr (multiple linear regression): generalization of slr to multiple independent variables.
   -logistic regression: introduced as a classification technique.
   - random forest: brief mention as a popular ensemble learning method.
   - k-means clustering: used for grouping data into clusters.
   - hierarchical clustering: another clustering method, organizing data into a hierarchy.

key concept discussed:
4 levels of measurement:
1. nominal:
  - classification 
   - data with categories, no inherent order.
   - example: gender (male, female, other).
2. ordinal:
  - classification 
   - data with categories that can be ranked.
   - example: educational levels (high school, undergraduate, graduate).
3. interval:
  -  regression
   - data with measurable differences but no true zero.
   - example: temperature in celsius.
4. ratio:
  -  regression

168,"the lecture comprised of how do we get the empirical equation showing the relations between inputs and outputs of the dataset. now to measure this equations, there are four types of measurements which we can do. nominal,  which includes indentify gender where we also discussed a fundamental problem of giving one of the class a higher numeric value than other even though we don't want to. ordinal, which includes classifying according to ranks like grades or salary. interval, which includes data measured along any scale where we discussed that the same difference between two scales have different significance ( 2.5 feet and 5 feet ; 5â°c and 10â°c ). ratio, which can be said as quantitative version of interval scale as it has some zero value which can serve as a reference point. then we discussed about the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning which nothing but the absence of labels in case of unsupervised learning. then we vaguely moved through the process of how the empirical relation is obtained by first clustering the features and labelling them to gain the required function.",-0.010558569,0.012749922,-0.024134083,0.04575514,0.052349634,0.043892127,-0.06980388,-0.07053962,0.036839318,-0.03683398,0.0610175,-0.09565203,0.027925404,0.026263166,-0.011606929,-0.05782917,0.047247365,0.046094246,-0.048059806,0.012175982,0.06325228,0.019480417,0.024290765,0.06848161,-0.021507127,-0.03092582,-0.004694796,-0.024004517,0.006216701,0.0015285336,0.029403875,0.10874321,0.0367434,-0.019158589,-0.12456163,-0.046031762,0.10887877,0.03927699,-0.0338266,0.07427629,-0.022303913,-0.057421055,-0.01843704,0.059256572,0.018724937,0.056268495,-0.038404282,-0.052467722,-0.13802333,0.037285022,-0.020218581,0.0975083,-0.093882784,0.043731112,-0.004048504,0.062202465,0.055793945,-0.039879415,-0.016204279,0.032149352,-0.06626003,-0.051411044,-0.07664451,-0.02315274,-0.026387425,-0.029335292,-0.04108584,-0.018977169,0.01488917,0.022513254,0.055343274,0.052717514,-0.046016537,0.06288343,0.066514894,-0.017763302,0.0009589117,-0.003852724,0.05353394,0.00040402703,-0.03376314,0.042686455,0.015149267,0.032659646,0.078444704,-0.044003792,0.035235267,0.018312698,-0.09041924,0.018306755,-0.036504027,0.058938194,-0.07656001,-0.0009038716,0.041733034,-0.009593217,-0.009192281,-0.03037763,0.101294324,-0.008249394,-0.003951554,0.03943554,-0.0949352,-0.02801743,-0.04255379,-0.023282727,0.03154799,-0.018979417,0.061669506,-0.043770347,0.010588944,-0.0606597,-0.14073534,0.005369704,0.023590308,-0.05056458,0.06934581,-0.0009894829,0.030913092,-0.049617242,0.012920264,-0.037257407,0.0014099879,0.055851035,0.019831143,0.017019192,-0.016434738,4.5651322e-33,-0.035525523,-0.069148555,-0.028145783,0.010580169,0.011794293,-0.01106298,-0.09370346,3.5463414e-05,0.115253545,0.043246266,0.0038574713,0.13828813,0.015825538,0.02334188,0.098212875,-0.021134738,0.010882047,0.10571807,-0.041992754,-0.088761635,0.039881743,0.030347655,0.057610143,-0.009817034,0.02207992,0.01781732,-0.07627345,-0.02144865,-0.01263463,-0.020772954,-0.0070690983,0.0005667514,0.043477453,-0.03836963,-0.039339423,-0.0428421,0.05173867,0.031061469,0.04370549,-0.02253242,0.012063787,-0.046276577,0.10769689,-0.06728222,0.0038444065,0.044363204,0.067805186,0.03419767,-0.02037317,-0.03759185,-0.082371704,-0.060608424,0.036892954,-0.09586904,0.009894445,0.11080721,-0.013318503,-4.9026923e-05,-0.14562838,-0.019751262,-0.042348817,0.009677446,0.088180915,0.014686062,-0.025761481,-0.027239116,-0.07238619,-0.0038984106,0.109659255,-0.019224456,-0.014626973,0.04990223,-0.04415008,0.020428285,-0.012692071,0.024528189,-0.0064561097,0.0022071959,-0.036272593,0.062181808,-0.025043543,-0.027810492,0.032727364,-0.06621511,-0.027199116,-0.017778946,0.032353323,-0.0053933,0.08148981,-0.0543758,-0.06446936,-0.035189815,-0.059441812,0.012424242,0.05375506,-8.370337e-33,-0.041318357,0.03258667,-0.043788493,0.012608934,0.02368863,0.027263615,-0.0060217236,0.07067496,0.010201238,-0.039220437,-0.053946726,0.0070836972,-0.023322096,-0.038806662,-0.037144102,-0.002549923,-0.077113755,-0.019714905,-0.047584828,0.048913915,0.027961688,0.03434005,-0.032134417,0.0064668516,0.0102971345,-0.028779464,-0.00121669,0.01589276,-0.07561407,0.058823783,-0.0078043663,-0.13094892,-0.02468275,-0.07945399,0.027778586,-0.04393465,0.013822966,-0.029667994,-0.054383516,0.068292305,0.021314433,0.0153805,-0.034862835,-0.09354498,0.09004023,-0.066470325,0.08594768,0.012718378,-0.02791943,-0.034216825,0.037689265,0.024224596,0.006915819,0.027870005,-0.02759123,-0.033872794,-0.0030950778,-0.0581332,0.014151451,0.07079435,0.047231387,-0.042704176,-0.06613784,0.1168688,-0.10226357,-0.06520622,0.037986785,-0.002881383,-0.073456325,-0.014160415,0.0077272984,-0.01283117,0.06671606,-0.057104006,-0.108377546,-0.038915742,-5.8161673e-05,-0.0058409483,-0.07050708,-0.03054194,0.006247921,-0.05802296,0.00808061,0.0005715259,-0.018555883,0.052995887,0.11474368,0.03858498,0.054359484,-0.07252858,-0.060863722,0.020297442,-0.14699039,0.0054670917,-0.023956543,-6.808678e-08,-0.0583007,0.02068443,3.430495e-05,-0.041420214,0.06523754,0.07998095,-0.04953875,0.018915776,-0.035451774,0.073842525,0.024988675,-0.017940639,-0.024511691,0.016915191,0.033232268,0.006670095,0.11135389,0.035019115,0.021386623,0.009799417,0.07448639,-0.03126617,-0.02602313,-0.05947267,-0.007696128,-0.04166735,-0.017249519,0.10328798,-0.011592552,0.03530605,-0.0015400046,0.030454941,-0.024655106,0.010024065,0.1048724,0.08498252,0.018381217,0.040593266,-0.070032895,-0.056055553,-0.047299895,-0.01963959,-0.025489122,0.015083639,0.0967485,0.01199961,-0.03787464,0.0708574,0.026879333,0.10194127,-0.033992406,0.052120004,-0.012640721,-0.035919003,0.026588377,-0.045784723,-0.080017544,-0.06368181,-0.08570642,0.017478926,0.09045112,0.019152874,-0.040724438,-0.03363275,3,26.062902,-15.150007,3
172,"we learnt about some machine learning techniques to fit data.
some techniques- include simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, logistic regression and random forest.
we studied levels of measurement like :
1.) nominal(just classification, not any ranking, also discrete)
2.) ordinal(it is ordered and discrete)
3.) interval(continous, absolute 0 doesn't mean absence of anything)
4.) ratio(continous, absolute 0 is defined by nature).
also nominal and ordinal are used in classification whereas interval and ratio are used in regression",0.008357111,-0.04147403,-0.011301376,-0.0044809817,0.01937432,-0.015494975,-0.07246147,-0.021464968,0.0062833913,0.0041552917,0.0022877206,-0.05379244,-0.008853834,0.038316693,-0.012121084,-0.043089584,0.034583427,0.047168076,-0.010575192,-0.015815437,0.05918126,0.045073118,0.032039363,0.050358284,-0.011872218,-0.0077080163,-0.032161094,0.025492616,-0.00468616,0.017624963,-0.045002088,0.021117063,0.0073361574,0.013520133,-0.10466115,-0.047788106,0.08403475,0.039225437,-0.056513704,0.021927726,-0.017480876,-0.0353511,0.007354758,0.03900149,0.078803554,0.100605614,-0.07877592,-0.049597435,-0.09534903,0.012212737,-0.10453585,0.041884087,-0.02505768,0.06120314,-0.059022494,0.043996044,-0.009418394,0.010146589,0.027647045,0.02324783,-0.014461381,-0.06671747,-0.07221936,0.006497262,-0.028400246,0.042522613,-0.08476381,0.01539135,-0.010705593,0.024723887,-0.0034424192,0.015565859,-0.02989937,0.07816785,-0.03161808,-0.05151801,0.0017608489,-0.0064850505,0.020770775,0.09108422,-0.10790938,0.044659935,0.001619137,0.08056252,0.0642054,-0.05957208,0.010505939,0.015534717,-0.12640077,0.020463811,0.009737095,0.018514298,-0.046827395,0.013223441,-0.012264246,0.005510523,0.02194806,-0.06008863,0.07207977,-0.029329829,-0.051737804,0.046389084,-0.0539255,0.018669618,0.009418251,-0.007882576,-0.021686504,-0.020571588,0.14770128,-0.06148118,-0.0687674,-0.00314993,-0.04498258,-0.09695626,0.034592316,-0.041397277,-0.04585625,0.013949518,0.012800768,0.013819791,-0.038186558,0.013506733,0.030339474,0.0024187593,0.086174645,0.07900418,-0.01030608,2.7784352e-33,-0.0013268854,-0.087201826,-0.017678635,0.018499406,-0.04184659,-0.042519648,-0.06358482,0.040548474,0.15976691,0.0790249,0.009961574,0.10972653,-0.013401809,0.07585698,0.10370699,0.031578824,0.02883563,0.091384456,-0.059104882,-0.021596842,0.017060291,-0.051963747,0.04947194,0.008348377,0.039947316,0.013081349,-0.05117882,0.04277109,-0.082666434,-0.00925768,0.0440905,0.030398859,0.010922176,-0.05433592,-0.0014856722,-0.046070077,-0.010465847,0.06656477,0.04057067,-0.009939038,-0.050436825,-0.052502897,0.08143117,-0.07037803,0.018943269,0.042636935,-0.0049506454,0.015980022,-0.025315953,-0.010023521,-0.039892197,-0.048893794,0.029948117,-0.05119166,0.013275139,0.069123104,-0.035252143,-0.04669159,-0.14403905,-0.0059955413,0.012141125,-0.041658845,0.05728259,-0.039667886,0.015514015,-0.011311948,-0.015374325,-0.008731903,0.041450214,0.0382383,0.011458669,0.013182192,-0.01715475,0.0055652466,0.045440353,0.037169766,0.035870552,0.0082206605,-0.02842537,0.0274768,-0.010907301,0.03561476,0.06486195,-0.07220561,-0.05252726,0.01931879,-0.0036220022,-0.027432477,-0.011851693,-0.07562078,-0.14730687,0.03397435,0.011702427,0.037037473,-0.020688115,-5.2148022e-33,-0.051603045,0.020011822,-0.025207715,0.022248117,-0.008357999,0.06708976,-0.04787725,0.027454628,0.059870772,0.03707587,-0.057279292,0.058199096,0.034950126,0.02629555,-0.035053067,0.052192993,-0.07839855,-0.020052595,-0.019552732,0.03945666,-0.0012412558,0.039730255,-0.087479815,-0.018203415,0.038281966,-0.027901135,-0.03779662,0.051998187,-0.06105498,-0.018485254,0.016668092,-0.07252263,0.02533091,-0.07936092,0.0405592,-0.052793536,0.027414976,-0.079412654,-0.016387906,0.09717706,0.0028233314,0.06690283,-0.041565645,-0.068363644,-0.009362899,-0.097592495,0.034445576,-0.044321064,-0.015994845,-0.039188687,0.05795522,0.059568267,0.05440899,0.00015928627,0.04185668,0.05483892,-0.095514625,-0.028997405,0.021219287,0.058758352,-0.03606264,-0.03897077,0.04711172,0.07952974,-0.088402316,0.054862965,0.050312907,0.08892452,-0.10438008,-0.07944709,-0.057982616,-0.0035603158,0.0363917,0.00783513,-0.1520718,-0.107881986,-0.024994768,-0.03653422,-0.08356126,0.024684524,0.019884173,-0.07863343,-0.07935676,0.043671295,-0.006949745,0.014281909,0.09552129,0.025051996,0.058974627,-0.06886391,-0.046397753,0.06180699,-0.0840379,0.022946313,-0.074017435,-5.215954e-08,-0.043754607,0.0058187936,0.069006376,0.00015093562,0.021249957,0.097076245,0.0041515785,0.09580141,-0.097608425,0.0719676,0.041825656,0.05923229,-0.07472945,0.007830933,0.04003285,-0.04567857,0.059932616,0.008467357,0.0059981802,0.06699669,0.07053655,0.028355515,-0.01897182,-0.043234095,0.08201173,-0.13093635,-0.0056015123,0.056824718,-0.01723035,0.07861181,0.014246509,0.08117746,0.043135785,-0.018139962,0.011592782,0.10973274,0.0077283643,-0.029582856,-0.09832659,-0.034284003,-0.023200026,-0.021048002,0.008279286,0.03349626,0.033492588,-0.0071736034,0.030133601,0.008712972,0.022942718,-0.0007104906,-0.0013005374,0.073816866,-0.016942536,0.021607582,0.046410017,-0.0111366315,-0.03297694,-0.043729246,-0.07353064,0.02712586,0.08047141,-0.019467525,-0.030812783,-0.018001925,3,27.259638,-15.40587,3
187,"sir started by talking about y = f(x). he first talked about old and new methods of data analysis. for this he took the example of finding the temperature difference between the two ends of a pipe using the flow rate of the fluid flowing inside the pipe. y was the temperature difference denoted by delta-t and x was the flow rate.

in the old methods we used to get the equation relating y = f(x) like dt = l23, while in the new methods we get data points and obtain a plot of the curve which relates temperature difference with the corresponding flow rate.

there are 4 level of measurements: 

1. nominal (discrete) - no ordering in this level of measurements , no calculated value associated with it. ml category - classification 

2. ordinal (discrete) - they have a sequence and associating a number to nominal and ordinal is not correct. ml category - classification  
we have to encode the names as vectors like dog [ 1 0 0 0 ] , cat [ 0 0 0 1 ] 

3. interval(continuous)-for eg 5 and 10 degree celsius like we don't have, since the concept of reference matters. in case of this , we have 0 has arbitrary defined . ml category - regression 

4. ratio (continuous) - since the concept of reference matters. in case of this , we have 0 has arbitrary defined. ml category - regression 

when we have both labels and features then - supervised learning
with only features we have then - unsupervised learning 

y = f(x) y - label and x - features 

(monthly purchases)  = f(salary, family size, ...........) 

types :
 
1. simple linear regression 
2. multiple regression
3. polynomial regression 
4. random forest 
5. multiple regression 

y = f(x)

no labels  -- ""unsupervised learning""
	           --  k-mean clustering 
	           --  hierarchical clustering

we have population inside which we have sample and no matter how large the size of data is it is always taken as sample . 

larger the size of the population more accurate prediction .

then he talked about unsupervised learning in which we don't know the value of labels associated with features .",-0.032889936,-0.07051359,-0.0011843841,-0.021950955,0.005319434,-0.036942292,-0.06830778,-0.010772879,0.054785088,0.0046901647,0.03204694,-0.067282714,-0.03596352,0.020997921,0.0028704524,-0.01617121,-0.018340262,0.0013040378,-0.0536952,-0.03428872,0.055244654,0.019128121,-0.038186394,0.056936648,-0.021269493,-0.010983472,-0.051111735,0.016675346,-0.0069550495,-0.019118955,-0.07565098,0.05824519,-0.005708183,0.05682219,-0.08395971,-0.048745554,0.09058461,0.025230283,-0.057825968,0.068355985,-0.04798111,-0.03676684,0.07446572,-0.012533824,0.06275613,0.088002734,-0.05360753,-0.085793205,-0.13713197,0.06086172,-0.04262776,0.06298037,-0.06372774,0.07514074,-0.02536141,0.021959828,0.05275496,-0.045142118,-0.061911635,0.052678786,-0.13816735,0.027761795,-0.09510865,0.043122306,0.02983143,-0.014543218,-0.042618256,0.03477861,0.05673297,0.034728315,0.0067650992,0.032469604,0.025062492,0.006274764,-0.005009833,-0.07089539,0.09609142,0.06440728,-0.0049192053,-0.025659256,-0.013898577,0.055519126,-0.003332376,0.043365017,-0.03312031,-0.054906845,0.0055212006,0.050478462,-0.07450456,0.016527323,0.028006146,0.042750124,-0.08175096,0.020118073,0.05767098,0.046679176,0.015535712,0.032674223,0.09460998,-0.004990538,-0.076668955,-0.0011923809,-0.088160366,0.04991001,0.064993195,-0.036955185,0.03695128,-0.02337755,0.09934017,-0.060196772,-0.035975255,-0.087574326,-0.04549349,-0.043940257,-0.021999326,-0.12454107,-0.05919489,0.0060953763,0.04851083,-0.029759305,-2.8563003e-05,0.005939003,-0.0077864234,0.028669035,0.03387007,0.06957377,-0.010106554,3.8753566e-33,0.005854026,-0.08022323,-0.009946593,-0.00033853168,-0.0016489112,-0.020944525,-0.050020773,-0.017466197,0.12684827,0.07339198,0.0048741815,0.08894576,-0.031885542,0.014184606,0.05975656,0.01571912,0.04869906,0.016484533,-0.064576976,-0.0245291,0.054671247,0.047372445,0.06174157,-0.053440753,0.046000354,0.06777707,-0.030403323,0.0063252575,-0.035836816,0.0248932,-0.018577144,-0.04296373,-0.024284648,-0.02291693,0.0338208,-0.021661863,0.044316683,-6.5788285e-05,0.02394972,-0.022705292,-0.0029107402,-0.024628775,0.016795589,-0.0033747626,-0.026190966,0.03468052,-0.08135446,0.044922803,0.020777019,0.032985095,-0.040926903,-0.06605145,0.056465376,-0.015221986,0.030619023,0.010945513,-0.036790576,0.021046873,-0.099196516,0.040801637,-0.059963297,0.058904592,0.08736123,-0.03867134,0.049220752,-0.0040594637,-0.012058832,-0.025233094,0.067217104,-0.0013517181,-0.030225301,0.061785873,-0.023252908,-0.069763504,0.08969311,-0.002640829,0.019127682,-0.030929321,-0.046096854,-0.0031018825,-0.046513736,0.012038616,0.07106362,-0.04314453,-0.055720385,-0.039053172,0.062690824,0.06465767,0.033569053,-0.07259777,-0.13628417,0.06030591,0.0123731205,0.09326153,0.06365037,-5.5894587e-33,-0.073754326,0.097907595,-0.012755848,0.054907046,-0.074634425,0.037910216,-0.016508613,0.020104878,0.06477626,0.040884756,-0.023949327,0.033085313,-0.040615514,-0.01618567,0.07221619,-0.008420852,-0.11425559,-0.050673135,-0.10651888,0.06412944,-0.014068758,0.11504795,-0.15882717,-0.03838866,-0.017091587,0.029682929,-0.0009853829,0.028345365,-0.058761068,-0.09763727,-0.013449355,0.003047112,0.019094145,-0.064358585,-0.008389454,-0.01716782,0.09362298,-0.062216967,-0.03273961,0.032145783,0.0049131955,0.026815098,-0.022504408,-0.113939226,0.008365327,-0.026609665,0.048878852,0.004942749,0.06145553,0.020288205,0.055374727,-0.021619866,-0.019664133,0.047844477,0.031043746,0.029739352,-0.03622904,-0.068110876,-0.0813,0.049882498,0.039134167,-0.047956966,0.05683083,0.059853952,-0.054743797,0.033024345,-0.002485065,-0.03360054,0.041925974,-0.03510409,-0.020318246,0.064457856,-0.019761741,-0.05985775,-0.036583863,-0.043289766,-0.021766141,-0.03635725,-0.04355938,0.04201803,0.010919689,-0.0016689786,0.022734808,0.06272077,0.028106257,-0.07062323,0.10941614,0.028715787,0.011006247,-0.05036996,0.04036115,-0.020499187,-0.053232156,0.06451811,-0.048195586,-6.585846e-08,-0.06050674,-0.027346622,0.005968066,0.078476585,0.0219312,0.06633839,-0.0683387,0.055438403,-0.0152612785,0.087606765,0.036089577,0.092613846,-0.067278534,-0.037204653,0.039696928,-0.026189541,0.09331688,-0.032939162,3.398481e-07,0.039698277,0.044514935,-0.034774713,-0.037338834,-0.0254972,0.0022921914,-0.04776198,0.021074405,0.09078277,0.029223235,0.016014153,-0.06605693,0.0807361,-0.027825112,0.045134522,0.06226993,0.03805939,0.015433757,0.032314062,-0.046629015,-0.046914298,-0.02195942,-0.018960256,-0.09024882,-0.00036526198,0.070765555,-0.03801381,0.0009616689,-0.020251011,-0.0037508854,0.12039363,-0.044373754,0.092767134,-0.023307877,0.030309271,-0.016032383,-0.03544523,-0.059904147,-0.03957259,-0.078317,0.04596861,0.04304389,-0.008533688,-0.006461514,-0.056775473,3,25.929693,-10.694174,3
191,"in data science, data is divided into 4 different categories according to nature of measurement as follows

levels of measurements : 

1. nominal : there is no ordering, only categorization is there. we can do frequency distribution on this data. it is discrete. example : gender, colour.
2. ordinal : there is inherent ordering in data. it is discrete. example : grades

in data science, it is advised not to assign numerical values to nominal and ordinal quantities because it gives them inherent value and order. for example : man : 1, woman : 0 looks like man has more value than woman which is non nonsensical.
we use one hot encoding to encode these data types.

3. interval : it is continuous. values have ordering and meaning. reference point has arbitrary definition. example : temperature.

4. ratio : it is continuous. reference point is defined. example : height, salary.


nominal and ordinal label types fall under categorization while interval and ratio fall under regression. 

sometimes labels are not available for data which goes under unsupervised learning while other is supervised learning.",0.030409131,-0.0011183996,-0.055857588,0.0002924892,-0.036569607,0.013348102,-0.056435313,-0.089856975,0.07950223,-0.013618605,0.025379268,-0.065449335,0.02305615,0.034307864,0.048613966,-0.041533057,0.048374716,0.041284684,-0.042289972,-0.041023307,0.068731226,0.02698098,-0.018102076,1.8421859e-05,-0.0016617308,0.003086949,-0.040683936,0.017810399,0.025686407,-0.0057374164,-0.063936986,0.0559386,0.027298773,0.034584586,-0.07870643,-0.07250384,0.03211459,0.0413533,-0.04075111,0.08414975,-0.03055143,-0.015349404,0.041489236,0.048514694,-0.008041305,0.046108253,-0.020713286,-0.088150404,-0.15262601,0.013567115,-0.035824705,0.09413224,-0.011982615,0.12666215,-0.044998016,0.026736302,0.023222756,-0.043092787,-0.03512977,0.03163101,-0.10859479,-0.0036631068,-0.041738443,-0.026898405,0.024469929,0.005671105,-0.050508764,0.01519692,0.029031731,0.042728487,0.022018965,0.02363801,-0.007506257,0.04262857,0.05244121,-0.036202524,0.044370983,-0.009947246,0.08647681,-0.0063581364,-0.0353909,0.015483472,0.0007634117,0.04766331,0.08883955,-0.05173728,0.04355563,0.055619314,-0.1395597,0.035585657,0.003136229,0.072941616,0.019685991,0.023289733,0.034962885,0.017797384,0.03587898,-0.029103102,0.10860885,-0.06898316,-0.031746764,-0.031915084,-0.09011115,0.03399812,-0.047199458,-0.10710483,0.038337495,-0.015123994,0.066587724,-0.052420523,-0.040250123,-0.004294236,-0.08678517,-0.07387421,-0.049096636,-0.052638654,-0.073517896,-0.009332142,0.030403787,-0.055370886,-0.03717107,-0.02359471,0.014698554,0.03107074,0.017917315,-0.004113526,0.018430734,9.3719755e-33,-0.033270743,-0.065261774,-0.050158728,-0.020033812,-0.00679153,-0.024644025,-0.088655025,0.0050383597,0.09935454,0.08491662,0.016905831,0.11429033,-0.02885069,0.09292785,0.073629946,0.036937974,0.06164197,0.09587275,-0.08697379,-0.015426677,0.041792367,0.040289532,0.043896835,0.012859773,0.044501983,0.032352228,-0.07084435,0.019960124,-0.034477893,0.0017431338,-0.02779979,-0.044171285,0.059673633,-0.05172272,0.0021998754,-0.026231667,0.036265373,0.06784792,0.020859629,-0.0048079574,0.037441496,0.004742083,0.025602497,0.05023547,0.0654509,0.05931705,0.048624475,0.036752276,-0.052626245,0.020389209,-0.039428413,-0.019081742,0.065353446,-0.059798725,0.01705849,0.029260201,0.00612834,-0.04210239,-0.13211015,0.033601396,-0.09259105,0.041951478,0.12965193,-0.04651328,0.042063057,-0.016244968,-0.06950838,-0.055684216,0.10193505,0.0154524725,0.009787101,0.10129133,-0.05631061,-0.007274522,0.003972286,0.04137454,0.008473428,-0.013472133,-0.05364178,0.041539297,-0.028471613,-0.0261479,0.022363706,-0.013865017,-0.047122627,-0.051577408,0.016908318,0.02325584,0.06602895,-0.06622585,-0.06311659,0.028555762,-0.0015589655,0.004788957,0.031424936,-9.9658624e-33,-0.06515096,0.06849188,-0.055537235,0.043667033,-0.036866043,0.030446136,0.016823787,0.003574489,0.09197669,-0.014833739,-0.024629207,-0.035078548,-0.03608944,-0.05392595,-0.020828472,0.0054793595,-0.16027737,-0.022474678,-0.07268078,0.07064128,-0.008115027,0.04319274,-0.13861728,0.035287693,-0.0054150596,0.015624266,-0.029559487,-0.025185548,0.0029213985,0.022662375,-0.030715887,-0.1063128,0.039710492,-0.08186077,-0.022774406,-0.07399965,0.060787868,-0.04710599,-0.06541357,0.0662575,0.007979899,0.044898883,-0.04653948,-0.051533397,0.028273705,-0.049212005,0.015957672,-0.036111165,-0.029620085,0.016021153,0.059776034,0.003975694,-0.03136894,0.01768273,0.031763867,-0.003863579,-0.07278714,-0.026524654,-0.012235179,0.06671729,0.032967787,-0.048254795,0.056038372,0.07207191,-0.08568076,-0.03299151,0.037128087,-0.036324445,-0.056507032,-0.08147981,-0.013018287,0.010773225,0.04458586,-0.026051398,-0.067546174,-0.09868688,0.02179023,0.0165516,-0.014606985,0.056129582,0.012741237,-0.002802906,-0.005172218,0.09544403,-0.04182378,0.031069014,0.07453846,0.0045372504,0.039715398,-0.052013755,-0.026097637,0.0053044213,-0.117987715,0.076716386,-0.04130244,-6.32075e-08,-0.027399633,-0.03458039,0.0063598054,-0.008473588,-0.0052097864,0.041817088,-0.007029751,0.0040776613,0.012117366,0.07061213,0.03755859,0.066745766,-0.06505738,-0.06782776,0.06882227,0.0042391005,0.116676144,-0.07117211,0.032395616,5.0445382e-05,0.011309922,0.038702287,-0.07138382,-0.04154066,0.02384244,0.00030275702,0.02228069,0.121589296,0.04240883,0.06513299,0.024842072,0.008575793,0.0113762515,0.014943448,0.026627973,0.013829449,0.0010029929,0.0010172866,-0.036248636,-0.04984027,-0.0073238052,-0.035720095,-0.08802753,0.0012856253,0.07063858,-0.0017090425,-0.033555765,0.07017809,0.022473402,0.087064214,-0.09517951,0.027592536,-0.03047769,-0.01705155,0.00747191,-0.003989355,-0.05678967,-0.040305544,-0.065126754,-0.025399664,0.12273912,-0.03449539,-0.053977028,-0.045593597,3,27.786322,-11.241405,3
217,"machine learning is the application of statistics in different ways like linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, etc. there are 4 levels of measurement: - 1) nominal type: it is a discrete type of measurement for example gender and color. in this measurement, there is no ordering defined. it differentiates the characteristics of something that you are measuring. 2) ordinal type: in this type, there is a sequence or order. it is also a discrete type. example: grades. 3) interval type: it is a continuous type. example: temperature. only the difference matters in the case of intervals. in temperature zero has an arbitrary definition. 4) ratio type: it is also a continuous type. it's all about existence. for example: height, weight, salary, etc. 
nominal and ordinal types are used in classification whereas interval and ratio types are used in regression problems.
""supervised learning"" is learning from data where we know features as well as labels.
""unsupervised learning"" is learning from data where there is no label. its input data consists of only features.
there is whole data which is called ""population"" data whereas the part of that whole data is called ""sample"" data.",-0.009677675,-0.047670648,0.015445519,0.07302304,0.023530817,0.037282165,-0.08461624,-0.0578387,-0.0027134432,0.026830178,-0.010304223,-0.014776055,0.009069781,0.043361437,-0.02169441,-0.066409476,0.03516906,-0.048993852,-0.0102094645,-0.007926089,0.08017074,0.018351095,-0.02785359,0.055356987,-0.0381225,-0.007061068,0.012878987,0.026735565,0.0006191457,0.059106935,-0.02055434,0.0099363355,0.014995536,0.0132013885,-0.084463686,-0.06258631,0.07731702,0.055288058,-0.063437164,0.001283788,-0.010492725,-0.07448884,-0.0110749565,0.042736206,0.13301149,0.10339139,-0.0786847,-0.07746878,-0.12694101,-0.032905042,-0.04075596,0.033052407,-0.011109191,0.098404795,-0.08260777,0.06281653,0.03656049,0.060112357,-0.018379448,-0.0014314003,-0.057267025,-0.091458246,-0.05445226,-0.061851863,0.00596533,0.021361804,-0.04791685,0.0075565143,0.024368783,-0.030404465,0.027809167,0.032111503,0.003389221,0.06645317,0.031760614,-0.07335224,0.00031671012,-0.017970994,0.04537389,0.0690962,-0.03825804,0.021597818,-0.0053666634,0.07212126,0.056042373,-0.046838842,0.020829594,0.017457556,-0.08117585,0.029251901,-0.0054486557,0.03809094,-0.04554461,-0.007988343,-0.007333559,-0.013313136,0.009955602,-0.02264735,0.050874125,-0.015209031,-0.0391215,0.014417997,-0.008726488,0.03582965,0.041886415,0.006069424,-0.003374616,-0.00590242,0.112331174,-0.06330871,-0.04899488,0.0109416265,-0.09349239,-0.057992484,-0.071645096,-0.06333268,-0.051618442,-0.008968596,-0.022352392,0.062102932,-0.011332826,-0.030924447,0.027198708,0.03420528,0.059696488,-0.008445475,0.0120078605,2.5864775e-33,-0.028578376,-0.105599955,-0.012784649,-0.0068431916,0.016918516,-0.040344756,-0.04122777,0.017641177,0.12195878,0.05990203,0.04251233,0.07153372,-0.0043259803,0.1298483,0.10291374,0.033339825,0.05874939,0.024873381,-0.07845493,-0.04670496,0.046385087,0.09525066,0.04420724,0.058839954,-0.0038202568,-0.027671535,-0.02978636,0.05698068,-0.06171535,-0.0051971283,-0.011856151,-0.028808977,-0.041263584,-0.029595485,-0.01645001,-0.024867602,0.009091816,-0.004259517,0.052136548,-0.060626816,-0.016791657,-0.04674546,0.11187813,-0.065839104,-0.0052208924,0.016892398,0.041921414,-0.012564016,-0.072387934,-0.028032444,-0.016928239,-0.06694972,0.033469703,-0.048274405,0.03483583,0.110453844,-0.012265335,0.016868668,-0.10344347,-0.037967812,0.010714292,-0.016604891,0.083432786,-0.061870147,-0.0117875505,-0.008047236,-0.033690076,0.014769779,0.061030034,-0.037219148,0.039324313,0.06957851,-0.040837504,0.056532,0.069992475,0.049824174,0.034035556,-0.024272196,-0.020433808,0.07340887,-0.0055360026,0.031518336,0.040407814,-0.07035472,-0.07705806,-0.00034057102,-0.019703602,0.018861797,0.084910706,-0.07284439,-0.11742735,-0.00061437744,-0.031777423,0.050316248,0.00973569,-5.7911486e-33,-0.0394637,0.07621285,-0.10849688,-0.0037089011,-0.022811625,0.047788374,-0.04735854,0.04945454,0.0054900628,-0.056201,-0.019613083,-0.00040759743,0.029420778,0.027135724,-0.05167003,0.079827495,-0.17579514,0.00811666,-0.056141216,0.06232016,-0.05383914,0.022031205,-0.036002688,-0.017321153,-0.011405043,-0.002483229,-0.037990917,0.08846688,-0.0068204445,0.08054975,0.031734187,-0.042936936,0.0044873813,-0.052269727,0.031200638,-0.07642213,0.03574804,-0.07051566,0.021085793,0.04725841,-0.010740359,0.032459084,0.025099888,-0.1057122,0.024117693,-0.06964859,0.010707546,-0.02540531,0.014607021,-0.06546321,0.019576168,0.08398047,-0.021956349,0.0031398488,-0.016279712,0.0076809223,-0.06245444,0.017564503,-0.013812561,0.03006451,0.0011873968,-0.07236871,0.008880394,0.083257265,-0.10764327,-0.033941828,0.041900337,0.039603706,-0.048094794,-0.06509707,-0.07297309,0.052558642,0.053352613,-0.04746449,-0.101665184,-0.0864511,-0.0075625274,0.031059809,-0.032110944,-0.021034656,0.007904546,-0.03474702,-0.03456876,0.058258522,-0.011114972,0.018703762,0.06293387,0.008050798,0.012371298,-0.09748251,0.014770257,-0.009199859,-0.07589642,0.08092631,-0.059386496,-6.587254e-08,0.01088492,-0.020035712,0.06940768,-0.049156398,0.05283016,0.02131312,-0.05630867,0.028542358,-0.019475687,0.07977897,-0.0005060885,0.04416846,-0.079990216,-0.056774374,0.011565914,0.057250295,0.087933294,-0.023555504,0.029891783,0.033909537,0.0341159,-0.08176432,-0.0054372735,-0.005917153,0.061195895,-0.10572881,-0.0014339688,0.061882157,-0.016907066,0.08399612,-0.06756852,0.07423816,0.04368004,-0.007852132,0.06035309,0.11740515,0.07419491,-0.056711525,-0.06782266,-0.073941216,0.007859001,0.039982297,-0.034273546,-0.009737139,0.04646909,-0.026869433,0.034550495,0.0044256644,-0.017899305,0.06000722,-0.011502542,0.05099868,0.019617895,0.030901637,0.010987963,0.040514395,-0.01429622,-0.10211718,-0.032911167,0.046666387,0.09645628,-0.0099231275,0.0030953595,-0.039368883,3,24.825787,-14.295594,3
242,"in this lecture we started by looking at how results were used to be predicted earlier, without any ml models. people used to collect data, through experiments and observations and then by using those x and corresponding y values they used to manually fit the data into some curve/relation which could then be used to predict future values.
but with the advent of ml algorithms, the need to manually determine relations has vanished and we can use various available ml models to fit relations among collected data and the model can predict any future values fed to it. some of these algorithms include- linear and multiple regression, random forests, etc.
next, we studied about the 4 levels/scales of measurement- nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio.
the nominal level categorizes the labels qualitatively into groups, which donâ€™t have any specific order. we can use frequency distributions to analyze this class of labels. also, since in nominal level, we do not consider ordering, it is incorrect to represent the values in terms of single numerical values. instead, we should use a vector which will have only one value as â€˜1â€™ and others â€˜0â€™ depending on which category the label y belongs to.
next, we talked about ordinal level which is associated with a specific sequence. the example we considered that of grades. grades have a specific order of importance but the interval between these is not fixed/defined.
the interval level consists of values that have equal intervals but the absolute zero for the measurements is not defined. in this level also, order matters. we discussed the example of temperature in celsius or fahrenheit scales. in these scales the 0 value is not absolute. so, we can just compare the difference between two values of temperature and comment on which one is hotter, but we cannot comment on the ratio of temperatures.
ratio class has an absolute zero defined and at this value it means that there is complete absence of that measurable. we considered example of height and weight here. so, heights of two persons can be compared and we can comment about the ratio of their heights. (eg. we can say a person with height of 5 ft is twice as tall as the one with height of 2.5ft.)
nominal and ordinal levels consist of discrete data, whereas interval and ratio levels contain continuous data.
next, we talked about supervised and unsupervised learning models:
supervised leaning models are the ones in which we feed the complete data, consisting of both the features and labels, based on which the ml model determines the future values. it uses classification or regression techniques for the same.
in unsupervised learning, only the x values are given based on the various x values (features) the machine learns by itself and makes clusters of values with similar features and assigns labels to each, after which it can predict futures values, based on the determined relations.
we use k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering algorithms for the same.
so, the ml models try to determine the function â€˜fâ€™ which relates y and x as y=f(x), based on available data.
we can always collect a sample of the entire population of data to develop these models.

268,"today we learnt about four  scales nominal, ordinal,interval ratio discussed examples to understand each on of them in detail. and also learnt that for discrete scales like nominal and ordinal we have to use classification ml models and for continuous scales we have to use regression scales. sometimes label and features both are given in that case we can use supervised learning models when only features are given we can use unsupervised learning methods like means and hierarchical

278,"in today's session we learnt about various levels of measurement which are nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio and their proper definitions and usage. learnt about how can we use these levels of measurement while solving a classification (nominal or ordinal level of measurement) or a regression problem (interval or ratio level of measurement). also how can we use numbers to represent nominal data using one-hot encoding which is just making the numbers as switches so that the data just takes value of 1 at the class it belongs to and 0 everywhere else. learnt a little about supervised and unsupervised learning which is basically the classification of a machine learning problem based on if we know the label 'y' or not. various techniques/algorithms we use for supervised or unsupervised learning were also discussed briefly. at the end of the class we were taught how we only know the data of a sample of a population even after so many technological advancements and we make predictions of the population based on the sample. also how the function y=f(x) has an inherent error because we don't have access to entire population data.

288,"the lecture covered some basic ideas on machine learning and statistics. machine learning is essentially finding a relationship between features-inputs and labels-outputs. to achieve this, methods like linear regression, logistic regression, random forests, k-means clustering, and hierarchical clustering are used. these methods help solve problems like classification-grouping things-and regression-predicting values.
the lecture also introduced levels of measurement, which describe how data is categorized:
nominal data is applied to name things without any kind of order, such as color or gender.
ordinal data is ordered, but the difference between them is not consistent, like grades: a, b, c. encoding the ordinal data using numbers can lead to problems since it may suggest a difference that does not exist. using vectors will help to avoid this.
interval data is used for measurement, like temperature, where zero does not represent nothing.
ratio data includes things like height or weight, where zero means nothing, and you can compare values meaningfully (e.g., 10 kg is twice as heavy as 5 kg).
in machine learning, if the label is nominal, the problem is classification. if the label is interval or ratio, it is regression. machine learning can be supervised or unsupervised. in supervised learning, labels are already given, while in unsupervised learning, there are no labels. clustering methods are used in unsupervised learning to group data by similarity, and labels can be assigned later.
the last discussion about the difference between population and sample occurred. population refers to the entire dataset, but there can be a size that may be computationally expensive to analyze; thus, we often use a sample which is actually a smaller, manageable part of the data.",-0.00093221094,0.01765317,0.024906514,-0.008857173,7.6054734e-05,0.03516901,-0.09858386,-0.068388,0.0057428945,0.00081948243,-0.018408358,-0.00038115418,0.053146813,0.0038413994,-0.005751707,-0.016213134,0.0033463852,0.049466543,-0.048710592,-0.054836202,0.071649976,0.026536327,-0.026114855,0.05853254,-0.018308418,-0.014070499,0.009131216,0.010850955,0.00053555495,0.047686577,-0.01787088,-0.00012483401,0.027869668,0.009714706,-0.14016917,-0.082254305,0.07579044,0.017992,-0.07379728,0.040261947,-0.02883416,-0.06879066,0.014122115,0.06122508,0.08503477,0.11019035,-0.070322454,-0.095230825,-0.12504028,0.045324188,-0.09587001,0.030635234,-0.030354131,0.02127688,-0.07199709,0.053512905,0.0039355257,0.005522811,-0.0037673218,-0.005127245,-0.073924586,-0.10960895,-0.046856344,-0.0073534707,0.0066877473,-0.030905675,-0.04328044,0.07039729,-0.013981279,0.02377505,0.028315188,0.013020664,0.0012239072,0.111390434,0.035546087,0.025480462,-0.016503938,0.009957585,0.06986125,0.010520429,-0.06324647,0.028781338,-0.0045427093,0.08643069,0.09381488,-0.06995577,0.00689695,0.028465725,-0.14508091,0.009884343,0.04447216,-0.004611742,0.03505308,0.021143144,0.02031634,0.018917952,0.015859561,-0.074450806,0.07409608,-0.036927216,-0.025233995,0.058211572,-0.060028795,-0.021904493,-0.030124832,-0.039406344,0.017311806,-0.007267848,0.13184753,-0.07076561,-0.0121134715,-0.010064638,-0.11922431,-0.05922819,0.0035927724,-0.07335992,-0.00022716081,-0.026224531,-0.0028639277,-0.00609192,-0.01942458,-0.03417685,-0.021251148,0.068337664,0.02023371,0.0069231624,-0.031932615,2.932293e-33,-0.0019304758,-0.08226764,0.0015326102,0.005122282,0.03138062,-0.081331074,-0.05907081,-0.0051154667,0.1019553,0.06366948,0.009801976,0.043704163,0.046841983,0.0711621,0.07694951,0.045879822,0.084874585,0.018231258,-0.053687938,-0.047369733,0.05484958,-0.0061413073,0.08685781,0.018426148,0.027871033,0.08258761,-0.030313779,-0.0036120699,-0.0028702726,0.0048962994,0.009532924,-0.0031796934,-0.050251435,-0.0102538625,0.02275359,-0.047722563,0.044788033,0.011305271,0.02121577,0.008364659,0.0072103576,-0.03369099,0.08329352,-0.03175164,0.037687004,0.06966932,0.055693634,0.017690174,-0.0047227154,-0.005185173,-0.080976434,-0.031298593,-0.017583536,-0.073061146,0.028394116,0.098113455,-0.0075686653,-0.02106127,-0.13679925,-0.020523503,0.007392342,0.026623996,0.09293496,0.003906655,-0.030610144,-0.0087793525,-0.02624651,0.011563827,0.07752934,0.001184144,2.1150106e-05,0.03134185,-0.040432684,-0.009048921,0.00062797894,0.049687706,0.037230715,-0.016766354,-0.032726306,0.011894702,-0.0035876902,-0.03443463,0.025868578,-0.076145045,-0.08291225,0.0032936272,0.015776562,-0.0055148248,0.0513454,-0.03499131,-0.0801669,-0.0013147652,-0.031409837,0.06464421,-0.023499643,-6.403367e-33,-0.044602968,0.06034536,-0.059565898,0.0008300905,-0.027259573,0.026169803,-0.039940402,0.013981451,0.05931871,-0.044334263,-0.063243434,0.05135557,0.04331275,0.0068657952,-0.002493531,0.040648922,-0.11248892,-0.006822811,-0.078004956,-0.0069583314,-0.03310247,0.06762261,-0.05019685,-0.032162376,0.024095472,-0.0023818396,-0.011284617,0.014427135,-0.023722926,0.026378194,0.0070650503,-0.10327079,0.0038872217,-0.06854101,0.06439084,-0.042314596,0.022135943,-0.08629864,-0.051512398,0.06284736,0.03713807,0.010841415,-0.0009411721,-0.11696065,0.019977251,-0.04782089,0.009291837,-0.00067257835,0.030690134,-0.040223803,0.061865546,0.071451,0.0047031012,-0.021760615,0.053090997,0.02982795,-0.110241555,0.0031427587,0.03695911,0.081344105,-0.018437685,-0.056449514,0.020214139,0.06289846,-0.07210324,-0.0007715242,0.008740922,0.010877148,-0.017234107,-0.082194746,-0.04571638,0.047583252,0.055490665,0.025328005,-0.14672495,-0.08190071,-0.02620254,-0.07268161,-0.11617915,-0.0006915941,0.008076407,-0.0953687,-0.016097438,0.10004093,-0.015246631,0.008271242,0.13669305,0.040284976,0.042396247,-0.06352274,-0.03300204,0.053225566,-0.110955246,0.08015162,-0.042794984,-6.278504e-08,-0.028745838,-0.007469623,0.048980087,-0.02133085,0.0256508,0.048101198,-0.047022212,0.041172516,-0.041112714,0.08929224,0.054721046,0.018749138,-0.08069223,-0.026244173,0.03115956,0.016520191,0.08127214,-0.003592663,0.02849671,0.033648185,0.03735366,-0.053522427,0.026772121,-0.009014175,0.031942606,-0.07989638,0.026065037,0.12973468,0.043766856,0.023817465,-0.056527846,0.05944627,0.07557915,0.040212777,0.032491636,0.0786137,0.026181882,-0.02175545,-0.038361404,-0.08585117,-0.04420216,-0.019753616,-0.057609264,0.032541737,0.08157856,0.014393047,0.017550142,0.034148876,-0.0055783894,0.06609186,-0.027551094,0.05657901,0.02537731,0.018899458,0.033652306,0.0006485817,-0.0357371,-0.08625574,-0.04607641,0.00043002496,0.09677098,-0.019274091,-0.024685139,-0.06752889,3,26.253078,-14.069385,3
299,"the basic idea of the session was to introduce the concept of deriving an empirical function which relates input and output. there are various models for classification and regression tasks. some models include simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, logistic regression, random forest etc.â€¨we got to know that machine learning is an application of statistics. â€¨there are four levels of measurement-â€¨1) nominal, which is discrete with no ordering.â€¨ 2) ordinal, which is discrete with inherent ordering in its values. â€¨3) interval, which is continuous but we cannot express the values in terms of ratios. for example, for temperature we canâ€™t say the body at temperature 10 degree celsius is twice as hot as 5 degree celsius. this is due to arbitrary zero reference.
4) ratio, which is continuous. ratios can be defined for them like height, weightâ€¨
we also got to know brief about supervised and semi-supervised learning. 
labels are provided in supervised learning, we just have to obtain the function. â€¨labels are not available for semi supervised learning which we can obtain using clustering methods.â€¨at the end we got to know that we donâ€™t have the information of entire population. we work on samples which is important statistical

335,"we started with the equation y=f(x) (for fluid flowing in pipe) where we have the values of the inputs (i.e. flow values) and output (temperature). earlier people used to derive the relationship between the inputs and the outputs empirically using mathematical formulations.
but now we have many machine learning algorithms which can give us the relationship:
1. slr -> simple linear regression
2. mlr -> multiple linear regression
3. logistic regression
4. random forest
5. k-means clustering
6. hierarchical clustering

then we discussed about the 4 levels of measurement:

1. nominal: eg - gender, color
    the data in this level of measurement can only be classified into different groups. there is  
    no ordering and the data is discrete.
2. ordinal: eg - grades
    this is also discrete like nominal but has an inherent order associated with it.

for working with the data we encode it by assigning the labels some values (like male-1, female-2, etc.) which is fundamentally wrong as we are completely ignoring the values of the assigned numbers.
instead, we can use one-hot code for the labels which acts as a switch making only a single value 1 and rest of them to be zero. for example, if we are classifying images of animals then for an image of a monkey the values will be [dog-0, cat-0, monkey-1, horse-0].

3. interval: eg - temperature, ph, credit score
    the data in this level of measurement is continuous. zero here is arbitrarily defined and  
    has no real meaning.
4. ratio: eg - height, weight, salary
    this is also continuous but here zero has a meaning in this level of measurement.

both nominal and ordinal levels are discrete and they fall under the classification ml category whereas interval and ratio fall under the regression category.

in the equation y=f(x), y are the labels and x are the features.

1. supervised learning: when we have both labels and features it is called 'supervised 
     learning'.
2. unsupervised learning: when we only have features and no labels it is called 
    'unsupervised learning'. 
    in this we use the features to group data into clusters and then on the basis of their 
    similarities we can define their labels and then predict the correct group for any new x.

at last we looked into the population for our data is too large that either we don't have access to all the population's data or we can't normally process such a large data.
so we take samples from the population to get the data with the aim being getting as close as possible to the whole population.",-0.012329484,-0.06362705,0.01362182,0.03718076,0.051241256,-0.012236177,-0.027315872,-0.08237447,0.0628003,0.013380344,-0.043396004,-0.086487316,-0.010200505,0.04379565,0.0066749784,0.0047604125,-0.009237376,0.06548313,-0.06333445,-0.14455125,0.018001476,-0.026515579,-0.024930356,0.07245681,-0.029045444,0.00574411,-0.01820564,0.0028800648,-0.040088043,0.007705312,-0.0022439829,0.046064917,0.059266627,-0.004775663,-0.11098902,-0.02725407,0.06858835,0.008894397,-0.0745485,0.05234001,-0.0107192015,-0.06507431,0.073700026,-0.041895717,0.040441096,0.051736757,-0.035887357,-0.07622239,-0.1535175,0.025849076,-0.016130889,0.0053337193,-0.027797211,0.097441845,-0.017335743,0.05778205,0.049226683,-0.06303947,0.01072672,0.042818498,-0.03929655,-0.008278213,-0.09802803,-0.017776784,0.07329089,0.023659768,-0.029885534,0.08656826,-0.007360535,0.012516643,0.033947762,0.038008478,0.011684261,0.03440594,0.009952425,-0.022316042,0.068497755,0.032447983,0.02882818,0.034711942,-0.048280496,0.06464626,-0.004914867,0.06989487,0.01885552,-0.05709731,-0.009418855,-0.027157716,-0.08611154,0.015487101,-0.059935935,0.0032398803,0.011779938,0.021693377,0.013505611,-0.0013355415,0.026978303,-0.08177144,0.09703898,-0.0032181751,-0.10293544,0.036591034,-0.0057360316,0.003087872,0.012085431,-0.033665646,0.014564539,-0.0062925704,0.114407025,-0.05615055,-0.070073105,0.028442778,-0.09840998,0.016740143,-0.008747334,-0.061821416,0.045585908,-0.028803997,-0.008634958,0.03409839,-0.022725014,-0.014569566,-0.0010754634,0.062073547,0.14306654,0.010121832,-0.014275534,2.6474908e-33,0.0018691258,-0.0686951,0.02633681,-0.008725351,0.06796272,-0.040263604,-0.064558014,-0.018436005,0.111656904,0.040716313,-0.010115894,0.12193551,-0.036415447,0.03684577,0.05940693,0.029151617,0.023892835,0.07620797,-0.07735007,-0.00018783167,-0.041069403,0.03804522,-0.017577281,-0.07196083,-0.026228873,0.043788977,0.00025881446,-0.0006556856,-0.005844739,0.013248053,0.011912704,-0.023665836,-0.03092825,0.0016523467,-0.03517329,-0.01488669,0.059629027,-0.007640139,0.034729254,0.015316834,-0.014181888,-0.04469069,0.096526235,-0.029879218,0.029532399,0.11643709,-0.046951614,-0.009537217,-0.056307364,-0.0044074166,-0.04838429,-0.033527646,0.052692417,-0.0030392497,-0.02869329,0.010014437,-0.03538911,-0.028073058,-0.05846004,-0.010138162,-0.070237234,0.015586527,0.035511345,-0.037117906,0.03885619,0.0034001113,0.044314634,-0.022217736,0.110885315,-0.033198465,-0.07109839,0.08613601,-0.048477504,-0.014510896,0.03535949,0.059135117,0.077332936,-0.03795569,0.0005559877,-0.012230011,-0.044882324,0.019241247,0.036626164,-0.035287872,-0.014953845,-0.009664688,-0.0068386123,-0.039390825,-0.05464989,-0.0013496974,-0.1546759,0.03120485,0.077249706,0.036186285,0.05514936,-4.5493744e-33,-0.031142028,0.04083665,-0.026373373,0.0246628,0.021876633,0.03852171,0.028350962,-0.008370687,0.045495674,0.010313439,0.004113015,0.018561274,-0.0073333867,0.040850874,0.060688153,0.009866963,-0.088069536,0.001221296,0.05943532,0.016514486,-0.015082271,0.12110243,-0.115568236,0.027190669,-0.07745481,-0.005659012,-0.03466621,-0.011763874,-0.031285483,0.047934107,-0.036840525,-0.0444751,0.019722331,-0.090568274,-0.015577745,-0.01828728,0.006593034,-0.022692619,-0.00862391,0.008897474,0.009797575,-0.019096168,-0.030441977,-0.08911142,6.2581414e-05,-0.04766104,0.06312737,-0.04093783,-0.028801134,0.03636692,0.01806507,0.00539081,-0.06192165,0.012946898,0.0055930135,0.024084607,-0.021485116,-0.010557133,-0.05889708,0.07427146,-0.011861057,-0.037871435,0.003297963,0.07260666,-0.077474296,-0.058556125,0.026139958,-0.053670112,-0.013909879,-0.06317439,-0.031528316,-0.021368017,0.106887996,0.04788043,-0.022857456,-0.108625606,-0.080521494,-0.0384273,-0.07365719,0.048946377,-0.02540805,0.020397803,-0.011443376,0.06593909,0.06147624,-0.07858395,0.12663968,0.02216177,0.1130379,-0.060299948,0.002335135,0.023615448,-0.10166163,0.017888092,-0.10177009,-7.247637e-08,-0.032139506,-0.0014420571,0.045124784,0.02010681,-0.010823693,0.036595277,0.011806805,0.108164154,-0.07257048,0.08292501,0.070601694,0.06359438,-0.07616107,-0.037841655,0.057440184,-0.004328913,0.04957786,-0.0057313587,-0.029262617,0.03579358,0.06911145,-0.011299029,-0.016018339,0.03128711,0.032937676,-0.0929215,0.04036586,0.06507666,0.04682291,0.0033802784,-0.030599304,0.051551927,0.016074628,0.11038859,0.022047509,0.08682791,-0.04500578,0.03985367,-0.027910309,-0.046741944,-0.019263865,0.002530478,-0.10080337,-0.014865298,0.09562684,0.04848252,-0.019866299,-0.004741487,0.0025875012,0.10947726,-0.0532186,0.05197524,-6.840869e-05,0.054037184,0.066810034,-0.034680136,-0.09351897,-0.040526718,0.010881162,0.009188479,0.106095314,-0.01990097,-0.07287659,-0.064950496,3,22.746042,-12.195779,3
346,"before the advent of machine learning, research involving relationships between variables, such as predicting temperature difference from flow rate, typically involved manually fitting curves to data. this required researchers to hypothesize and test various equations (e.g., delta t = l^2, l^3, 1/l).

with the emergence of machine learning (ml), the approach shifted. instead of manually fitting curves, researchers employ a wide array of ml algorithms. these algorithms allow models to learn the underlying relationships within the data without the need to explicitly define the equation's form. essentially, ml algorithms search for the best fit within a predefined set of functions.

levels of measurement

the level of measurement of a variable significantly impacts the types of operations that can be performed on the data.

nominal: variables at this level have no inherent order (e.g., gender, color). they are discrete and categorical.
ordinal: these variables have an order but the intervals between them may not be equal (e.g., grades: a, b, c). they are also discrete.
interval: these variables have a consistent scale, but zero is arbitrary (e.g., temperature in celsius). they are continuous.
ratio: these variables have a true zero point and consistent intervals (e.g., height, temperature in kelvin, salary). they are continuous.
assigning values to nominal or ordinal variables can introduce bias. for example, arbitrarily assigning numerical values (e.g., a=1, b=2, c=3) may imply an incorrect quantitative relationship between categories. a more appropriate approach is to represent these variables using vectors (e.g., a=[1,0,0], b=[0,1,0], c=[0,0,1]).

while continuous variables like temperature are often measured discretely (e.g., by thermometers), they are typically assumed to be continuous for the purposes of data analysis.

supervised learning

in supervised learning, the goal is to predict a target variable (y) based on a set of input features (x).

if y is a nominal or ordinal variable, the task is classification.
if y is an interval or ratio variable, the task is regression.
unsupervised learning

in unsupervised learning, the data lacks labels (i.e., the value of y is unknown). the goal is to discover patterns and relationships within the data using only the features (x). common techniques include k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering.

the entire collection of data points constitutes the population. in ml, algorithms typically work with a sample of the data, which is a subset of the population. it's crucial to understand that no matter how large the sample, it will always represent a portion of the population.",-0.056312826,-0.030114658,0.033728257,0.09433646,-0.020024957,-0.068088196,-0.11161058,-0.03672592,0.065803416,0.008765988,-0.03464946,-0.057815824,-0.003640278,0.013956915,0.02532232,-0.022722073,-0.02771834,0.04053326,-0.08374538,-0.07204809,0.009317239,-0.04682557,-0.081797056,0.040373515,-0.020105643,-0.031540878,0.006141352,0.026653998,-0.04767742,0.046696916,-0.014329006,0.021365311,0.033016082,0.018870795,-0.073452055,0.0151893655,0.024499753,0.03273954,-0.047234464,0.015335182,-0.0388567,-0.07071257,0.06244623,0.009337535,0.12962905,0.060322326,0.012895844,-0.047909986,-0.17222801,0.044205505,-0.10966272,0.0022440662,-0.026237892,0.060336325,-0.011988362,0.026409362,0.045476846,-0.002472106,0.016467,0.057493508,-0.11341706,-0.0476002,-0.09733691,0.0070707574,0.032933988,0.016849874,-0.017526612,0.04433032,0.017388713,0.04332854,0.007600854,0.0536826,-0.019965397,0.058189895,0.024619767,-0.00013143916,0.064978644,0.012243189,0.039603055,0.023516703,-0.038985156,0.03543344,-0.030481298,0.08075848,0.04695838,-0.09226211,0.006695164,0.002621649,-0.014870188,0.008506002,0.022142678,-0.016285162,-0.10044559,-0.010548709,0.04720573,0.08272332,0.03717575,-0.08194142,0.07551313,0.029657679,-0.04844042,0.06630954,-0.012852588,0.039459974,0.027045775,-0.033703763,0.02304009,-0.035790373,0.0968825,-0.07110615,-0.05847398,-0.030466165,-0.01680301,-0.031515174,0.07566478,-0.11587142,-0.030661257,-0.032666657,0.003994376,0.0718417,-0.06758229,0.0147574,0.021127,0.014119247,0.04325056,0.06824133,-0.08008228,4.307407e-33,-0.022146905,-0.026664406,0.0037089784,0.05030262,-0.034179717,-0.06391456,-0.074592985,-0.022188736,0.15073736,0.08392589,-0.03177101,0.0880424,-0.035826128,0.06313163,0.03946074,0.05785968,0.01812247,0.030058755,-0.06717049,0.000607688,-0.021839166,-0.0745943,0.027108327,0.002376131,0.039787453,0.062699065,0.016250119,0.054829475,-0.04623256,-0.0059433146,0.030515417,-0.022768192,-0.022588432,-0.0110207265,0.016560284,0.0073448257,-0.020339735,0.0047686696,0.026692213,0.030823456,0.019001676,-0.020537987,0.11502322,0.049938075,-0.017375499,0.07336401,-0.058051944,-0.036156885,-0.04458278,0.013895549,-0.05407385,-0.022560013,0.015628409,-0.04971723,0.02161232,0.08390792,-0.03749368,-0.03794298,-0.10003438,-0.01669507,-0.00013633577,-0.021262618,0.056302536,-0.0034010997,0.04428544,0.05056235,0.01670126,0.040905677,0.06407517,-0.018153789,-0.02670147,0.051607616,-0.044663202,-0.056564193,0.060682587,0.0016250832,0.06892902,-0.066633455,0.059228092,-0.033020392,-0.042578675,0.052831255,0.104467705,-0.07296891,-0.03670773,-0.080409944,-0.014114428,-0.040913153,-0.011146035,-0.10872276,-0.11566069,0.048434615,0.011046885,0.11176319,0.02110345,-5.2715658e-33,-0.063118435,0.011494136,-0.049700215,0.043426722,-0.03171397,0.013549828,-0.037596814,-0.04738884,0.09371463,-0.0065558637,-0.026065456,0.0058231284,-0.0013838903,0.016799496,0.04094458,0.03179548,-0.06071385,-0.037819777,0.0014149899,0.013429149,-0.069903865,0.041547265,-0.08271326,-0.031726625,-0.021683006,-0.011691846,-0.042628307,-0.0059977476,-0.051787153,0.024871761,-0.021549981,-0.01521351,-0.011315643,-0.054534543,0.014562825,0.039738912,0.026203481,-0.0330923,0.0194711,0.013964699,0.021665026,0.049254354,-0.008344886,-0.095777616,-0.012117282,0.0051619234,0.04854096,-0.040350717,0.07561607,0.0029490462,0.036826763,0.015033555,-0.02788084,0.0003770305,-0.037559412,0.04010412,-0.06279854,-0.017020922,-0.00814145,0.04414142,-0.035783958,-0.09085094,0.047410086,0.10909377,-0.10750895,0.041671325,0.010974803,0.03206871,-0.017328389,-0.031365957,-0.013117539,-0.037302844,0.013576071,0.008882709,-0.09741527,-0.09341016,-0.0268068,-0.050726566,-0.06379293,-0.022686038,0.0334418,0.001381239,0.02145221,0.020239046,-0.014778631,-0.02421974,0.058472097,-0.0012792133,0.0022560689,-0.05352042,-0.03362275,0.016147695,-0.12752835,0.04748382,-0.12394173,-6.831524e-08,-0.06221475,0.027895305,0.051353488,0.02857485,0.0928848,0.05823472,-0.012078224,0.10430679,-0.056341987,0.08272301,0.050037194,0.07621986,-0.018156914,0.006124492,0.025796544,0.016594648,0.054088213,-0.01081901,-0.03760707,0.0064964397,0.023422467,-0.020076055,-0.056569517,-0.03539574,0.14088435,-0.09344733,-0.027796622,0.10078209,0.0090112295,0.05674279,-0.053025603,0.043550164,0.039449543,0.020014118,0.05243527,0.13216771,0.057577193,-0.034678597,-0.042161938,-0.044694323,-0.044745464,0.07864639,-0.048326045,-0.00062039547,0.075624466,-0.023327798,0.049719732,0.02605659,-0.01580669,0.08350714,0.033906225,0.06364036,-0.019795168,0.01441131,0.027839482,-0.020941155,-0.019085474,0.0111530395,-0.018428197,0.063464224,0.038623497,-0.003528244,0.012407956,-0.067369655,3,23.131056,-10.853366,3
357,"there are 4 different types of measurements:-
1. nominal:- no absolute ordering between data types. ex. gender
2. ordinal:- discrete data with ordering. ex. education level.
3. interval:- has no absolute zero and is continuous. ex. temperature.
4. ratio:- an absolute zero is defined and is continuous. ex. length
 for ordinal and nominal we use classification.
interval and ratio we use regression.
general equation of a ml problem is f(x)=y where x is the input y is the output and f is our algorithm.
supervised learning is used in data with labels and then we try to predict accurate labels for unknown data, whereas in unsupervised learning unlabeled datasets are classified into clusters.

364,"today's class covered the concepts of simple and multiple linear regression, logistic regression and k-means clustering theoretically. we also covered the 4 different levels of measurement namely nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio. nominal and ordinal deal with categorical and discrete variables while interval and ratio are for continuous variables. nominal is primarily used for qualitative and quantitative data presentation and ordinal like in case of gender or colour and ordinal is primarily for ranking data in a particular order. interval deals with a particular order too but between two specific points. in this case zero value is considered arbitrary. an example is temperature- relation between 100â°c and 50â°c is not the same as 50â°c and 25â°c but same as 150â°c and 100â°c. they do not have a linear relationship as zero is not the true zero in this level. ratio considers a true zero and linear relations may exist.
another concept we learnt was the basic equation in machine learning, y=f(x). here y is called label and x constitutes the features. models having labels are called supervised learning techniques and those without labels are called unsupervised learning techniques. k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering are used to make labels.",-0.00964609,0.0028877158,-0.04572959,0.060829412,0.013795778,0.037611753,-0.05444129,-0.060936246,0.093888335,0.015113716,0.08156056,-0.08348894,0.07758611,0.07478954,0.050832093,-0.023373505,0.033783857,-0.0018060146,-0.08163139,-0.026167747,0.05692736,0.011364255,-0.033660345,0.076418124,-0.026419314,0.013739402,-0.007459753,0.027089588,-0.0021751826,0.07746118,-0.09045913,0.07860409,0.011810822,0.03298256,-0.07496297,-0.027882295,0.08052255,0.050790995,-0.10157217,0.069142,-0.042465817,-0.013045302,0.045444656,0.03806922,0.07342066,0.09995735,-0.10950937,0.001716331,-0.11906206,-0.01956481,-0.030504705,0.06976086,-0.069036834,0.063519716,-0.01489419,0.031165965,0.0036422946,-0.021388426,0.03687624,0.04860021,-0.055043314,-0.011075556,-0.052837655,-0.016583914,0.036608215,-0.03707411,-0.050543666,0.011800736,-0.022882752,0.03116389,0.026151855,0.0057369266,0.02981901,0.037684046,0.02878648,-0.0074472376,0.054665763,0.024408903,0.020002997,0.025744084,-0.032496292,0.041089393,-0.0134351915,0.0153779555,0.002762155,-0.094999604,0.045287266,-0.0058704074,-0.030548256,0.04176984,-0.028642062,0.0421284,-0.03160336,-0.062179755,0.02871472,-0.001316115,0.019036364,-0.01783924,0.10052017,-0.039483592,-0.0246554,0.01406388,-0.0621536,-0.028649738,0.00027615193,-0.02448499,0.014574124,-0.045131158,0.12054183,-0.0171816,-0.10947602,-0.013548521,-0.12779629,-0.03992062,-0.017053327,-0.07794255,0.067114525,0.0008209316,0.048644137,-0.043568697,0.029072918,-0.0068357494,0.021224694,0.122509696,0.058814235,0.001171436,-0.022699367,6.772728e-33,0.030685192,-0.071733765,0.031796988,-0.039529923,0.009092056,-0.06506377,-0.11723913,0.025376922,0.10755259,0.022768637,0.019057008,0.12814738,0.028974935,0.056702167,0.07458859,0.011752253,0.0870628,0.0813271,-0.028296497,-0.03527167,-0.035596658,0.008316919,0.06218016,0.02399001,0.00037282944,0.04328067,-0.009627114,-0.011706982,-0.02941491,-0.021017019,0.038651213,0.017665232,-0.038501423,-0.030553525,-0.034812585,-0.02357279,-0.0025417062,0.006516369,0.065360606,0.029563168,-0.054003265,-0.031780742,0.057295967,-0.084040225,0.060295094,0.07808642,0.020671487,0.053777166,-0.070603475,-0.00012453394,-0.08372068,-0.056670573,0.045466416,-0.023453074,-0.025043044,0.103200436,0.022691347,-0.04545232,-0.1221868,-0.04866312,-0.10783015,-0.010574928,0.030360978,-0.07166743,-0.0032423888,-0.019278262,-0.025540816,-0.020343786,0.06882707,0.035616215,-0.02159972,0.102275826,-0.011627043,-0.0027998714,0.014066161,0.017547265,0.02385795,-0.023940468,-0.06368138,0.021171004,-0.067179725,-0.04261854,0.04471489,-0.06235758,-0.06087387,-0.022549646,0.0013268646,0.018767057,0.016262045,-0.110180244,-0.12426087,0.008457894,0.0057863686,0.07026841,0.04590549,-8.342506e-33,-0.036265574,0.008684181,-0.03920726,0.0314631,-0.014932425,0.019322548,0.009492876,0.051976323,0.02679274,-0.01868435,-0.013404211,-0.0024459127,0.033768788,0.028242495,-0.008611188,0.0859494,-0.0899242,0.069728866,-0.039455924,0.08209668,-0.05909463,0.0249089,-0.06545603,-0.022087561,0.00050991034,0.022070263,-0.020171156,0.0110120755,-0.08472632,0.05833209,-0.0038169164,-0.051989377,-0.0054370523,-0.10488204,0.008711906,-0.009443343,0.007222847,-0.107123725,-0.05860689,0.0018418648,0.0054647652,0.019118007,0.051345345,-0.062001243,0.010723768,-0.09281676,0.0991865,-0.023196198,0.012195282,-0.0005785873,0.002902092,-0.018126635,-0.0010599296,0.037930496,-0.020672094,0.0031908527,-0.091715544,0.008121142,-0.020406704,-0.02697341,0.04978241,-0.102521956,0.04851722,0.09295992,-0.083602116,-0.028626377,0.017558854,0.0012069589,-0.0573333,-0.042636838,-0.023266295,0.04970032,0.0571456,-0.030083528,-0.11591156,-0.084727585,-0.006541962,-0.04146993,-0.085938215,0.050713576,0.0034599078,0.018467726,-0.09188069,0.019980885,0.009344716,-0.03297005,0.08930719,0.08757586,0.047060847,-0.039428107,-0.031364076,0.025260203,-0.07917679,0.07138028,-0.07223756,-5.7910924e-08,-0.021128224,-0.01300115,0.011152629,-0.019197477,0.04306546,0.01651153,-0.0056304634,0.0032315527,-0.04269227,0.05608579,0.048092935,0.07765348,-0.06901568,-0.024693469,-0.020783007,-0.016045827,0.06324421,-0.043667413,0.037470028,0.0097150775,0.014407541,-0.034972247,-0.049137253,0.0054656737,0.07236104,-0.04890976,0.020191817,0.12904407,0.05153428,-0.0042553097,-0.06888452,-0.0015663819,0.03472514,0.019405046,0.05780931,0.0904537,-0.0055542877,0.05995538,-0.06537203,-0.08303104,-0.026974592,-0.025270076,-0.046724886,0.018213488,0.0754046,0.009938534,0.013569304,0.052680105,0.03214882,0.046261325,-0.058840454,0.07308455,-0.057765845,0.0097361235,-0.006440616,-0.0092076445,-0.07932272,-0.03746061,-0.0010298302,0.029433832,0.042962924,-0.047985017,-0.028641861,-0.017963711,3,25.287668,-12.571654,3
373,"firstly we learnt about the basic ml techniques which are used in data science such as simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, logistic regression etc.

and how using ml techniques curve or graph are plotted for scatter plot for given data to know the relation between input and output which forms empirical equation. along with that we learnt the four levels of measurement which are :
1. nominal - in this no particular order or sequence is followed for data values. it takes discrete values. for example, gender or colours in which one value is not at higher or lower value from the other this are not in particular order but at same level.
2. ordinal - in this data  follows a certain specific order or sequence. basically it has a inherited order but it also has discrete data values. for example, grades which have discrete values but grades have a high or low value.
3. interval - in this data is divided into certain intervals in a particular order, but zero has a arbitrary meaning. it has continuous data values. for example, temperature ( 5â°c is not twice as cold as 10â°c in actual. )
4. ratio - data follows a particular order with equal intervals but zero do have a meaning. it also has a continuous data. for example, height and weight.

nominal and ordinal falls in classification category of ml while internal and ratio falls in regression category of ml.

learnt about y=f(x), where u is label and x known as features. in supervised learning labels are known but in unsupervised they aren't. in unsupervised k means clustering and hierarchical clustering are used to make label for problems.

385,"so today's discussion start with two types of machine learning model which is supervised and unsupervised. for example supervised ml includes - simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, random forest and unsupervised ml includes k-means clustering and hierarchal clustering. the most fascinating things is that whatever type of ml we will use always get a generic equation - y(x)=b0 + b1x + b2x2 .....
further ahead we have learnt about 4 levels of measurement -
1) nominal - it have discrete values and we can only categorize them. also there is no ordering between them. example - gender, color
2) ordinal - it also have discrete values and work same as nominal level of measurement. example - grades
3) interval - it have continuous value. the concept of 0 is arbitrary in this case. example  temperature
4) ratio - it also have continuous value. in this measurement 0 has a meaning. example - height, weight, salary
 in case of nominal and ordinal we use one-hot encoding to change words into numbers by making vector.
we learned that in y =f(x) where y is the label and x is called features.
when we have both labels and features then we use supervised learning and when we have only features then we use unsupervised learning method. nominal and ordinal are use for classification purpose whereas interval and ratio are use for regression.

403,"in the class of 15th january, we studied about features and labels. we represent in the form of y = f(x): where y represent labels and x represent features. earlier these equations were found manually but now we have ml algorithms to do this work. how we classify learning based on the presence of labels: supervised learned (labels present) and unsupervised learning (no labels present). we also learned about the level of measurements with their examples. there are four level of measurements: nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio. the first two belong to the ml category of ""classification"" while the other two belong to the ml category of ""regression"". then we also understood the meaning of the word ""sample"". how it differs from population.

404,"got to know about unsupervised, supervised and semi-superwised learning algorithms. there are 4 types of measurements, they are: nominal(discrete), ordinal(discrete but has order associated with it), interval(continuous & have an arbitary zero) and ratio(continuous & have an absolute zero). difference between these measurements was also discussed. also, we came know about different types of machine learning used to tackle the data within these types of measurements. e.g., for nominal and ordinal, classification is used. for interval and ratio type of measurement data, regression is used. unsupervised learning algorithm is used when label is not defined priorly, it uses clustering methods like k-means and hierarchical clustering to analyse the data and then make meaningful outcome from it. sometime it is also possible that we don't know the label, from y=f(x) and thus we don't know the relation between y and x which essentially the function f which is unknown.  machine learning algorithm uses the large amount of data available (sample of the population) and try to draw relations between y and x (i.e, it tries to find function f). once the f is known, the algorithm or model

420,"four categories of measurements exist: 1. nominal: there is no precise hierarchy among data kinds. for example, gender 2. ordinal: ordering of discrete data. for example, educational attainment. 3. the interval is continuous and lacks an absolute zero. for example, temperature. 4. ratio: a continuous, absolute zero is defined. for example, lengthclassification is used for nominal and ordinal data. regression is used for intervals and ratios. when x is the input, y is the output, and f is our algorithm, the general equation for an ml problem is f(x)=y. while unsupervised learning groups unlabeled datasets into clusters, supervised learning uses labeled data and attempts to predict appropriate labels for unknown

446,"in today's lecture we learned about various techniques to make predictions for certain parameters. these techniques include simple linear regression ,multiple linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, etc. then we discussed the 4 levels of measurement named nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio. nominal and ordinal are discrete while interval and ratio are continuous. nominal has no real meaning of order like team a, team b being represented as 0 and 1, but there's a problem as in representation of these 2 teams the numbers used create an order(0<1) and hence a solution to this was by vectors. some examples of interval scale include temperature, ratio include age which can be compared etc. in ml ,nominal and ordinal are used for classification and interval and ratio are used for regression. then we discussed the differnence between unsupervised and supervised learning which is supervised learning uses labeled input and output data, while an unsupervised learning algorithm does not. at the end we discussed difference between population and sample and talked about how both lack and abundance of data can affect the algorithm.",-0.015506456,-0.010230511,-0.045778796,0.02255008,0.0530628,0.050765038,-0.10935621,-0.04405495,0.1044429,0.014052256,-0.0016629446,-0.007712398,0.031449515,0.07396522,0.015433227,-0.06472628,0.015922016,0.0028421478,-0.060413063,-0.037831154,0.08746958,0.010768,-0.020633131,0.05145299,0.016320297,-0.021869417,-0.036259186,0.005221996,0.019985577,0.0029389402,0.0021767002,0.04920427,0.08550753,-0.007603901,-0.1638984,-0.04635847,0.08165267,0.051016986,-0.090103485,0.053085826,-0.02345036,-0.039340734,0.014186852,0.057772703,0.0349221,0.09862053,-0.07989329,-0.040726937,-0.16116112,0.039654683,-0.08944793,0.02353608,-0.017329466,0.0458763,-0.05412046,0.010837049,-0.02816923,-0.019660298,0.00650363,0.0055079823,-0.12692755,-0.054428782,-0.076106645,-0.038478658,-0.02100663,-0.017882483,-0.06651996,0.025895387,0.0028489444,0.057757683,0.04187287,0.032633226,-0.021571955,0.048347693,0.04177073,0.013577417,0.0031779294,0.009146065,0.061465133,-0.006215768,-0.033814784,0.046984132,-0.04548845,0.05061777,0.048109777,-0.054290175,0.0577074,0.053917877,-0.049457178,0.022955958,0.028122887,0.073974065,0.0037926172,0.023064114,0.049649652,0.0293952,0.030301893,-0.027069146,0.092110164,-0.0039978516,-0.017432608,0.007936507,-0.076498985,-0.022655506,-0.011252715,-0.021755505,0.01411927,-0.025096387,0.13699163,-0.046989545,-0.011231675,0.024316672,-0.101650864,-0.029225763,0.0028618437,-0.1162939,-0.020479543,-0.00025053357,-0.0018300298,-0.02084256,0.03632652,0.012765596,0.042455446,0.074942924,0.04018805,0.07317044,0.0016243343,7.6231764e-33,-0.03506364,-0.067600854,-0.020916073,0.06430119,-0.024612868,-0.021185614,-0.08225341,0.007046871,0.10897141,0.027083246,0.0035553554,0.062599376,0.03731836,0.06832132,0.120122,0.004087199,0.08571637,0.08485827,-0.048575927,-0.070711136,0.0005772067,0.007843135,0.022650389,0.0021130529,0.058145165,0.027161999,-0.04957451,-0.00083694997,-0.043914016,-0.021395864,0.053572316,-0.0097834645,-0.040474005,0.012101901,-0.03767138,-0.025547067,0.0152847115,0.010344888,0.032623537,0.021921597,-0.028394932,-0.0707496,0.05499478,-0.042535372,0.06769988,0.012241072,-0.0004333624,0.054580715,-0.07984325,-0.026291542,-0.06800966,-0.010920036,0.042980075,-0.09548443,0.062565394,0.08048821,-0.01548831,-0.0072221695,-0.13675337,-0.05413148,-0.033332553,0.020777233,0.093260184,-0.044556856,0.024043432,0.010138874,-0.012499714,-0.009852803,0.07917906,0.0037862107,0.010830474,0.042072706,-0.05794695,0.020893019,-0.016033126,0.028974483,0.04198101,0.014219572,-0.0064800913,0.07058488,-0.032508392,-0.02209056,0.029873753,-0.06375822,-0.04698439,-0.009414227,0.026985183,0.010206005,0.04795171,-0.044227373,-0.14258213,-0.003184742,-0.012185476,0.06809248,0.03249753,-8.5898126e-33,-0.04658406,0.005682005,-0.0053937663,0.01745564,-0.009373622,-0.014556246,-0.010638057,0.005534661,0.050819337,-0.031416908,-0.08050003,-0.0050573526,-0.011535754,0.0021111623,-0.012138441,0.042332765,-0.071796015,-0.047210757,-0.054036736,0.01031443,-0.01372708,0.05464958,-0.09830338,0.009598731,0.02170205,-0.028108805,-0.014125239,0.045961075,-0.07867522,0.02656206,0.028449155,-0.1299093,0.046986386,-0.059937928,0.008606624,0.0056827706,0.0029614903,-0.10993817,-0.06054142,0.06365786,-0.015965324,0.035404176,0.018191151,-0.10326296,0.012303605,-0.06425009,0.05840544,0.0009978409,-0.018570585,0.0043917065,0.025916914,0.07866296,-0.030549925,-0.005380253,0.0065024444,-0.023902263,-0.051576335,-0.062721826,0.044189714,0.03433145,0.038198274,-0.029651597,0.0025502923,0.0747799,-0.0989325,0.025042493,0.0038635877,0.071076386,-0.08443433,-0.06774066,-0.036516935,0.011602196,0.07984001,0.0013694456,-0.13959154,-0.053015444,-0.00968793,-0.0049346318,-0.07827036,-0.01782943,-0.028774166,-0.037357192,-0.032036453,0.066389605,-0.072706945,0.049524225,0.124414094,0.041525446,0.045042716,-0.0399768,-0.028224427,0.0102183,-0.07371312,0.04776851,-0.01535061,-6.824459e-08,-0.052793518,0.017903725,0.052057743,-0.032078005,0.043195013,0.039837655,0.003203333,0.009548704,-0.021585623,0.10093305,0.01713009,0.024473505,-0.07323228,-0.0038183795,0.059818897,-0.0022021062,0.055434104,-0.0187893,0.005530794,-0.015995216,0.06316038,0.0036190706,-0.059180178,-0.036538478,0.06109489,-0.100857206,-0.008845133,0.11676927,0.0029824984,0.04917729,-0.03698526,0.07435018,0.009985988,0.034635507,0.08487475,0.08123956,0.019470517,-0.017408516,-0.023666928,-0.10140847,-0.01754323,0.011857899,-0.035994984,0.016173856,0.09083455,-0.032880865,-0.022190591,0.004089559,-0.0061742268,0.0016449098,-0.058466025,0.06301327,0.016010324,0.040120896,0.09239524,-0.012757911,-0.06344002,-0.059429538,-0.044316463,0.026320754,0.096397966,-0.03904159,-0.026719233,-0.02750249,3,27.055552,-13.931101,3
452,"class 3 summary: 
first of all we talked about how to fit a curve. with some example he made us clear what were the intentions behind y=f(x) in statistics and ml. he told there are various methods to approximate f() and listed some of the methods like simple linear regression, mlr, logistic, random forest.
then we moved on to levels of measurement: there are four types: nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio. 

1. nominal includes discrete data which we can not arrange in a specific order( no one is bigger or smaller) like colours. 
2. whereas ordinals are discrete and can be comapred. 
3. intervals are the units where only difference holds not ratio. suppose, there are 5c and 10 deg c. we can not say 10 is twice as 5 deg c because we compare wrt kelvin where this statement will not hold true.
4. ratio. as the name suggest we can also take ratio. for eg height.

y=f(x1,x2,x3,x4..)
where y is the label and x1,x2,x3... are generally features in a problem of classification.

supervised learning :
        labels and features are known we predict and approximate the function f.
unsupervised learning:
        only features are present. we can just group the data on the basis of some parameters.

data availability: 
               the whole data set which includes each and everything is called population.
                  sample data is a subset of population.
we always take a sample because we can never have the population. no matter what the data can be be never called as population practically because it is always possible to leave some data behind.

459,"there were 3 main topic of discussion in todays lecture:

1. types of ml algorithms like simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, k-means clustering, etc.

2. level of measurement:
    1. nominal scale: datapoints are discrete, mutually exclusive and no arithmetic operation can be performed on this. eg: gender, color

    2. ordinal scale: datapoints are discrete, numerical but same unit of distance doesnâ€™t have same significance. for eg: grading, you have values from letâ€™s say 10 (for aa) to 4 (for dd). now why i was saying that the numerical values doesnâ€™t have significance because the difference between (cd and dd) is 1 grade points and the difference between the (aa and ab) is also 1 grade points. so numerically this means the jump from ddâ†’cd and abâ†’aa is same which is definitely not true.
        
        here we shortly discussed about how to encode the datapoints gathered using nominal scale. and we delved into the problem that directly using numbers to represent the datapoints is incorrect so we used the concept of vectors and how we use vectors to represent these data. and this vector way of representing things is called onehotencoding in the ml landscape.
        
    3. interval scale: datapoints are discrete, numerical and same unit of distance have same significance. for eg: temperature scale, you have values from letâ€™s say 100(degrees c) to 0(degrees c). if you go from 40â†’50 or 80â†’90 the change in temperature is 10 and this will feel same in both the cases.

    4. ratio scale: datapoints are discrete, numerical, same unit of distance have same significance and has a zero. for eg: in temperature scale if you have 0 it doesnâ€™t means you have absence of temperature which means 0 doesnâ€™t have significance in the scale. now take the example of height, weight, etc. where letâ€™s say you have 0 as the datapoint so it means that the object has no height according to the measuring scale (by the way this depends on the least count measuring scale).

3. types of problems in machine learning:
    1. supervised learning: we have a set of input features and an output feature. and our job is to determine the relation between input and output. this has 2 types of sub-problems: regression and classification. here regression refers to those problem which have continuous set of values in the output feature and in classification you have some finite number of different labels and our job is to determine the label of a datapoint based on input features.

    2. unsupervised learning: when we only have input features. here we discussed about clustering algorithms which is used to cluster the datapoints based on some sort of similarity finding algorithm (using euclidean distance, cosine similarity, etc).

4. we also shortly delved into the difference between population and sample. got to know about how all the machine learning problems are trying to learn from samples and based on the finding of relation of input and output (y = f(x)) trying to predict the behavior of

460,"we started with discussion of empirical relationship with example of flow rates v/s temperatures and gradually listing ml algorithms used widely. the whole problem breakdowns to 2 components: machine learning and statistics where stats forms the basis for ml. henceforth, we discussed the 4 levels of measurements:
nominal: discrete and unordered data; eg. gender/ color
ordinal: discrete but an ordered data; eg. grades/ age
internal: continuous but undefined ratio; eg. temperature
ratio: continuous along with well defined ratio; eg. height/ weight
later, we discussed that nominal and ordinal levels come into account for classification problems whereas interval and ration boils down for regression problems.
next, we discussed about supervised learning (labels and features both present) and unsupervised learning (only features present)",-0.054313403,-0.014971207,-0.0067165797,0.07221813,0.06776129,0.017613987,-0.07977261,-0.08887153,-0.014260396,-0.032989234,-0.027368123,-0.07496206,0.007577341,0.077245764,0.019855216,-0.041223824,0.042999383,0.071600385,-0.044773307,-0.053943187,-0.03392524,0.042792358,-0.04796748,0.10477728,0.02585584,0.014696056,0.0029172965,0.0012766068,-0.020472428,0.0502919,-0.0065518706,0.0380142,-0.00034256774,0.0020838561,-0.08541407,-0.0591543,0.05281624,0.028199442,-0.12240689,0.028591303,0.010216492,-0.098297976,0.007552084,0.033797648,0.055497322,0.1088134,-0.05836536,-0.07702018,-0.13757186,0.032655254,-0.050370656,-0.02553763,-0.017768119,0.07990505,-0.059758317,-0.011998003,0.03946403,-0.03771945,0.02223904,0.03952203,-0.048397895,-0.0680296,-0.08699075,-0.018612288,-0.009167138,0.0028095492,-0.037123237,0.09736021,0.03631905,0.032807663,0.042298518,0.110442005,-0.037203826,0.0234714,0.0062426934,-0.038754288,0.018305643,-0.010684003,0.04575158,0.008185392,-0.019668002,0.0021336991,-0.0067706956,0.027256243,0.036263183,-0.07358924,0.03904223,0.03533113,-0.11381748,-0.0005945902,7.234842e-05,0.034776367,-0.03629636,-0.0359896,0.040678855,0.03642816,-0.026083156,-0.07880862,0.06953329,0.00022635334,-0.0726397,0.04541132,-0.021130309,0.063065484,0.007253966,0.02313791,0.044518244,0.0012136966,0.107319,-0.07278553,0.007019237,-0.009960586,-0.08953034,-0.07978542,0.05398733,-0.123201266,-0.03945091,-0.025949566,-0.0048530917,0.07468933,-0.02061459,0.05813247,-0.0018322557,0.040463246,0.074525766,0.020961562,-0.024162618,6.359652e-33,-0.0064080725,-0.06413858,-0.044007517,0.045126837,0.056432486,-0.008048414,-0.08468506,0.010345182,0.14133328,0.05336997,0.023675667,0.086670846,-0.057706356,0.06278204,0.09563988,-0.023864856,0.023263758,0.11191853,-0.029976668,-0.044005096,-0.018296769,-0.028817916,0.03623437,-0.01314067,0.027806265,0.011388519,-0.02875312,0.017475162,-0.016644523,-0.00083703606,0.003907991,-0.034083664,-0.04155166,-0.011588363,-0.018671563,0.011731539,0.0026191918,0.041296195,0.03907103,0.02247104,-0.011306095,-0.037742596,0.075160615,-0.048889577,-0.034876224,0.036653396,-0.03603955,-0.025724161,-0.047891032,-0.056700204,-0.06773095,-0.050835658,-0.008786401,-0.118502446,0.007996705,0.08593941,-0.045934074,0.006496354,-0.11918389,-0.018944327,-0.045348153,0.05779675,0.03357406,-0.092551835,-0.017979018,0.018883603,-0.011825178,0.0521808,0.040261783,-0.037955664,-0.04441381,0.05174013,0.0002837786,-0.010601335,0.05165412,0.037971642,0.07668022,-0.039942075,-0.027307063,0.021297218,-0.028430404,-0.050471824,0.06819867,-0.048258875,-0.037164878,-0.053919192,-0.011888451,-0.020800786,-0.012616303,0.020805122,-0.14752452,-0.012012951,0.023218507,0.062117036,0.046283986,-8.0545586e-33,-0.0722833,0.04506929,-0.028678441,0.027004892,-0.0046942784,0.041039594,-0.00896601,0.06390163,0.05600686,-0.004731933,-0.027958287,0.0052406513,-0.024361,-0.02755229,-0.018176818,0.034019444,-0.094894,-0.015965298,0.044303473,0.05918406,-0.08436877,0.110267565,-0.09414091,-0.041043255,-0.057117313,-0.0061867987,-0.03664733,0.0272758,-0.051032905,0.046274986,-0.01620304,-0.10273858,-0.04180329,-0.06676832,-0.003158988,0.0023889253,0.02521389,-0.056153327,0.0016566345,0.093320556,0.063746534,0.008785693,-0.018201021,-0.046628937,0.03380989,-0.081676714,0.03185519,0.011251531,0.03112424,-0.016145855,-0.010233447,0.01990354,-0.0846747,0.026482062,-0.026604235,0.0015631751,-0.006194838,-0.026917372,0.0060075223,0.060131636,-0.018044664,-0.043111514,-0.023799364,0.062475834,-0.04655395,-0.04573188,0.022163281,0.023716489,-0.041785896,-0.004216603,0.039697457,-0.0052588372,0.033838592,-0.018834738,-0.02929087,-0.0825473,-0.021116158,0.016135931,-0.07710697,0.007957028,-0.0035279691,-1.0035859e-05,0.0053108484,0.056022614,0.044138215,-0.023908166,0.08819827,-0.058819603,0.09114004,-0.09527011,-0.034464683,0.0068400837,-0.04862859,0.030423105,-0.015942005,-5.485822e-08,-0.06150836,-0.012958538,0.065225,-0.028211674,0.07684611,0.055236626,-0.046024796,0.10578713,-0.050651047,0.07941283,0.07358704,0.06611715,-0.040262584,-0.012693504,0.015147087,-0.013406055,0.07305859,0.06006132,0.025912376,-0.038402673,0.09184239,0.0050047226,0.06526953,-0.038496803,0.018395137,-0.09669562,0.021971378,0.076920554,0.04762787,0.019749986,-0.06045988,0.041918345,0.043565534,0.0034067277,0.12287712,0.057272214,0.051711626,0.02037002,-0.09833865,-0.053379145,-0.058595225,0.027100233,-0.07551846,0.01672368,0.07137735,-0.022695528,0.041742325,0.0038214184,0.004299838,0.06874743,-0.008690167,0.027685232,0.051223386,0.09029756,0.074633464,-0.0054647126,-0.043594606,-0.041776106,-0.045902394,0.04042707,0.07236932,0.029720819,-0.06146006,-0.034398794,3,23.436401,-13.817842,3

481,"learnt about 4 different levels of measurement:-
(i)nominal:data is categorized into groups with no ordering.used for discrete data.example:gender,color,etc.
(ii)ordinal:data is categorised into groups which have ordering.used for discrete data.example:grades
(iii)interval:data is categorised into groups which have ordering and intervals between consecutive points are measurable but zero has arbitrary meaning.used for continuous data.example:temperature(5â°c is not twice as cold as 10â°c)
(iv)ratio:data is categorised into groups which have ordering,intervals between consecutive points are measurable and zero has a definite meaning.used for continuous data.example:height,weight
the machine learning category for both nominal and ordinal is ""classification"" whereas for interval and ratio it is ""regression"".

also learnt about y=f(x) where y is label and x contains features.the problems which contain label are called supervised learning problems and the ones which do not contain are unsupervised learning problems in which we use k-means clustering and hierarchial clustering to make labels.

there was one key point made that no matter how large the size of the data is,it is always considered a sample of the population.",-0.01614928,0.014117363,-0.020629423,0.053461578,-0.010822202,-0.009582684,-0.021877438,-0.02446099,0.034008924,0.008718356,0.03265265,-0.047196012,0.043014817,0.08601767,0.0021831754,-0.030876787,0.02786884,0.048463102,-0.08973345,-0.09450614,0.07142298,0.039295666,0.0007560023,0.10220548,-0.03337144,0.032740194,-0.012504811,0.0031447448,0.013156597,0.033571642,-0.049685698,0.04349283,0.023759957,0.0041914466,-0.10174775,-0.025944605,0.062841006,0.02778834,-0.07554323,0.05548224,-0.022403296,-0.012812868,0.03298634,0.034979414,0.06947261,0.07716175,-0.053560607,-0.09418531,-0.142516,0.019332567,-0.054594748,0.040848125,-0.067776084,0.10221063,0.013960315,0.04938105,0.022374623,-0.01631923,0.017139362,0.030697351,-0.04335039,-0.050963238,-0.060698234,-0.0067870193,-0.022050237,0.0063425126,-0.018935548,0.037016854,0.022439055,0.034131408,0.020118773,0.06569239,-0.00072832307,0.06129317,0.03797245,-0.02236498,0.04566639,0.019536901,0.027601387,-0.010131747,-0.007962551,0.040274445,0.0005487499,0.04016282,0.08446967,-0.05600631,0.042724155,0.003436673,-0.14833598,-0.006797502,0.015164468,0.038721267,-0.042769607,-0.00028353167,0.035231113,-0.010233552,0.014835356,-0.03478373,0.104277164,-0.024203544,-0.018684939,-0.0021619205,-0.040789906,0.05297354,-0.023569718,-0.05952906,-0.014902882,-0.046127573,0.09633421,-0.040421616,-0.08262325,-0.024958424,-0.09918778,-0.07096021,0.021378128,-0.045983344,-0.009839638,0.002856352,0.030436687,0.055350427,-0.041081835,-0.021567311,0.04493036,0.04111248,0.047742456,0.015187518,-0.0133760115,9.4298304e-33,-0.001274479,-0.11337915,-0.015142816,-0.014744586,-0.012372438,-0.07566947,-0.068372436,0.042451758,0.11388956,0.02684912,0.051221825,0.13624398,-0.007835001,0.06600444,0.12859342,0.005109204,0.022731617,0.059914127,-0.062108096,-0.019433664,0.018030422,-0.021335853,0.1046614,0.006588168,0.0344775,0.021916926,-0.031346492,0.01329393,-0.041507814,-0.0062096207,-0.019155543,-0.039405227,-0.0053048134,-0.0048788395,-0.03724043,-0.02744837,0.035080418,0.0029337734,0.0128962705,-0.05463177,0.0057800533,-0.02986707,0.12813891,-0.023709629,0.05589222,0.050669104,-0.036238547,-0.0018642485,-0.02672252,0.013019924,-0.06418645,-0.06034821,0.051828854,-0.11034369,0.0013877328,0.08212583,-0.013579347,-0.03538904,-0.091515094,-0.013127349,-0.07383502,0.020146972,0.05077517,-0.0035121532,0.015339791,0.01935918,-0.052426267,0.012047751,0.09938207,-0.01718574,-0.004748307,0.023727838,-0.011513059,-0.012853922,0.07584948,0.022510221,-0.021455927,-0.022347964,-0.07356193,0.00894926,-0.0039942134,-0.049789276,0.03752979,-0.08155214,-0.08431424,-0.03308902,0.033493496,-0.027890965,0.051638495,-0.034965433,-0.14902402,0.02470407,0.016105238,0.071667485,0.004474182,-1.0264346e-32,-0.03857207,0.06262223,-0.09222105,0.027019208,0.019572387,0.033785656,-0.008471339,0.023012899,0.059072256,-0.04103289,-0.041229587,0.0016996922,-0.032145467,-0.0021637818,-0.039381005,0.020456564,-0.11585831,-0.060244292,-0.03125106,0.05736436,-0.048315365,0.043646514,-0.14549826,-0.013030407,-0.022071432,0.0035268518,-0.01905386,0.013792043,-0.017601497,0.030131165,0.0016024899,-0.09434207,0.009015618,-0.07985865,-0.049694568,-0.07153044,0.055006184,-0.1183557,-0.05615006,0.024220385,0.030693958,0.08075114,-0.0029886349,-0.048473693,0.011952734,-0.061247613,0.034213413,-0.006259331,-0.035864975,0.024019407,0.01754613,0.001643197,-0.06701347,-0.017492717,-0.004139876,0.029982097,-0.037087142,-0.012748473,-0.02395182,0.034129463,0.024642695,-0.05181491,0.028589487,0.100853786,-0.087689966,-0.009943866,0.0326879,-0.01604156,-0.046837486,-0.026247745,-0.04911487,-0.008158194,0.03981453,-0.06418275,-0.059919327,-0.077819996,-0.037726827,0.016053434,-0.06967488,0.013730894,-0.0056820386,-0.07231842,-0.044008456,0.13307624,0.0016832402,0.0011436242,0.079578385,0.06385204,0.09231767,-0.072409734,0.007266317,0.008192,-0.09242044,0.07347365,-0.034908663,-6.359912e-08,-0.031997982,-0.026325151,0.05836124,0.008646616,0.04688131,0.0011452858,-0.050925534,0.09959813,-0.029537775,0.072845675,0.053561885,0.07694759,-0.1139726,-0.0577633,-0.015909191,0.021878356,0.095047764,-0.014792329,0.033994365,-0.011066472,0.028774172,-0.010707266,-0.017914059,0.019046852,0.024371391,-0.044731252,0.028692145,0.08650429,0.04570016,-0.013992914,-0.05276268,0.04099767,0.07199589,0.011891547,0.058095105,0.075811215,0.011562868,0.029367516,-0.08240245,-0.038399845,0.0031055468,-0.045354895,-0.015199529,0.0049960962,0.036791008,-0.013047213,-0.010899063,0.0657055,0.038667787,0.045754883,-0.09140538,0.04968709,-0.055239372,0.03435503,0.046593305,-0.0049171043,-0.061647605,-0.07465421,-0.0478096,0.012958092,0.11911277,-0.024181677,-0.083204634,0.035097867,3,25.102528,-13.182369,3
485,"in todayâ€™s class, we explored how statistics serves as the foundation for machine learning, with ml being an application of statistical principles. we discussed data typesâ€”nominal, ordinal, and intervalâ€”using examples like temperature to illustrate their differences. the session also introduced key concepts like linear regression for predictive analysis, logistic regression for classification tasks, and random forests as powerful ensemble methods. additionally, we touched on k-means clustering, a popular unsupervised learning technique for grouping data. overall, the session provided a solid understanding of the statistical and algorithmic tools that drive data science.",-0.05263172,-0.010273023,0.035912015,0.07244721,0.05815053,-0.0027379903,0.011415334,-0.08906634,-0.043416258,0.059294898,-0.01760005,-0.018547313,0.042583138,-0.012841689,0.0362448,-0.016610239,-0.017668447,-0.007115432,-0.04033217,-0.06255343,-3.926301e-05,0.0368237,-0.0347511,0.026515914,0.056245636,0.04747608,0.073179334,0.00957984,-0.013244365,0.027592389,-0.0769205,0.023028104,0.022582594,-0.0017276632,-0.08120933,-0.024364201,0.06833237,0.05214514,-0.07824038,0.052444346,-0.057698525,-0.0627976,0.051484812,-0.02581224,0.05883037,0.08964051,-0.0940551,-0.04336463,-0.01663172,-0.009151766,-0.0629302,-0.03805196,-0.025581006,0.048374034,-0.091514654,0.077519454,0.01575828,0.0043817,0.054472726,-0.010780889,0.003939186,-0.09795661,-0.055310734,0.03100105,0.02527639,-0.02109241,0.0047123167,0.094583616,0.026713522,-0.037374668,-0.02641771,0.08136579,-0.03213654,0.070197955,0.06364052,0.034677926,-0.014613695,-0.030214775,0.059377342,-0.013346363,-0.053696558,0.019983849,0.0010279319,0.07353821,0.05999079,-0.05639543,0.02289176,0.040269833,-0.03820747,0.008997281,-0.011236984,0.04234876,0.065155976,0.0050397357,-0.08774626,0.014069158,0.012385605,-0.065263376,0.103484206,0.06539025,-0.069033034,0.063732624,-0.038038764,0.0057362174,0.0026376073,-0.09598321,0.020511433,-0.063574776,0.12711674,-0.048283454,-0.02951515,0.0022679921,-0.10711622,-0.055084754,-0.00881047,-0.09911844,0.007051867,0.046804078,-0.00056706497,0.007380981,0.045542546,0.027900469,0.010629076,0.07786055,0.08018917,0.00819497,-0.04443609,1.6054968e-33,0.040386364,-0.07402789,0.011824309,0.013732139,0.06625644,-0.06251827,-0.08849684,-0.038515788,0.065770626,0.03805567,0.0333835,0.079224296,0.020803869,0.08556056,0.09033534,0.048300304,0.056886557,0.06569731,-0.06867735,-0.09594416,0.008967458,0.030966194,0.035861596,-0.0075587956,-0.02553684,0.047127835,0.026412195,-0.015754784,0.022734253,0.010313315,0.04886749,-0.034784496,-0.11226872,0.02075831,0.030643726,-0.01355247,0.0072975485,-0.04824407,0.07822304,0.058307797,-0.03305196,-0.01968072,0.08045526,-0.11287028,0.020902975,0.06839628,-0.003920911,0.041758865,0.0018760747,-0.0469142,-0.083466955,-0.093811676,0.046950784,0.031659316,-0.050277732,0.12124446,-0.016417447,-0.019733712,-0.056691438,-0.02667805,-0.07518562,0.021205356,0.04084484,-0.07506392,-0.08067869,0.008696836,0.024716923,0.07430874,0.04551216,-0.011471146,-0.01961661,0.10674891,-0.018206175,-0.004479028,0.0104410285,0.07634946,0.10556784,0.056351162,-0.0393645,0.0047700913,0.0012330533,-0.042139307,0.0022921418,-0.10410373,-0.03537329,0.023939878,-0.006207725,-0.034523655,-0.057604786,-0.035343055,-0.16779137,0.031665955,-0.011711408,0.047323726,0.01810374,-3.2477675e-33,-0.05965607,0.0010940419,-0.022263125,0.026632512,0.012398607,0.05363909,-0.07099492,-0.021855855,0.010128508,-0.0059684133,-0.018060308,-0.005840833,0.07015478,-0.045006596,-0.03407757,0.039233025,-0.03889268,0.019293107,-0.04101943,0.02998678,-0.0767925,0.0295425,-0.032587186,-0.06443655,0.0070716576,-0.05508949,-0.03085929,0.025505457,-0.06938192,0.04763438,0.0067931446,-0.036966857,-0.061664313,-0.0703694,-0.053750504,-0.0068195853,0.026040887,-0.06455832,-0.013879918,0.047884393,0.0001345462,0.022951333,-0.020502891,-0.06904256,0.0066754357,-0.06341629,0.024641264,0.008322242,0.011058691,0.011125911,0.019135209,-0.016758341,-0.037948903,-0.01352184,0.005730754,0.0104506025,-0.0101365,-0.046696816,-0.016232073,0.015108791,-0.034976974,-0.0598282,0.018047882,0.094531916,-0.04747499,-0.06586137,0.016049817,0.01231081,-0.03628754,-0.023960778,-0.0062847324,0.011150799,0.053059965,0.00013435264,-0.107468896,-0.057407312,0.03182008,-0.03723652,-0.064678475,-0.0078132665,0.04978123,-0.09088045,-0.015960222,0.050730754,0.08381167,0.071504995,0.10933705,0.023410752,0.06710535,-0.03444011,-0.08071242,0.06544673,-0.018679138,0.057434652,-0.061783545,-4.0707597e-08,0.01517506,-0.0040990273,0.04560864,0.013110668,0.06761386,0.02048454,-0.05459956,0.12649858,-0.08149253,0.026867578,0.09079168,0.013911986,-0.036651146,0.0067619146,0.025003595,-0.015812865,0.029909063,0.024233198,-0.03269644,0.008502994,0.03615459,-0.08825511,0.039036844,0.002319994,0.07345295,-0.07371971,0.023769666,0.078312226,0.0382958,0.013242923,-0.11980784,0.04490094,0.0050466657,-0.0036737127,0.09365902,0.07257971,0.017642243,0.03268545,-0.07610211,-0.07606502,-0.0139309885,0.055746466,-0.06561595,0.042073984,0.034329675,0.003586119,0.04281318,0.0051932945,0.044106446,0.05234757,-0.005898784,-0.0068587707,0.055440746,0.060243726,0.036988884,0.08590771,-0.03846012,-0.04138416,0.040034857,-0.022429317,0.06880876,-0.04635667,-0.08520237,-0.007535945,3,21.51364,-14.006788,3
488,"first of all we learnt about names of different types of techniques like slr which is simple linear regression, multiple linear regression ,logistic regression, random forest, k means clustering and hierarchal clustering we learnt about their names only first. whatever type of ml technique we use we will always get generic equations of type y=b0+b1x1+b2x2.....
there are four different levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal ,interval and ratio. we learnt about each of them in brief: nominal like gender and colour, we can only categorise them there is no ordering, we can only create a count from them .we can't calculate mean median mode .measurements are always discrete in this category. then comes the ordinal level of measurement for example grades aa , ab like that.this is also for discrete values .assigning numbers like 1,2 is wrong as 'b' will have double value then 'a' so we use encoding like 1and 0 -giving values. then we have the interval level of measurement which is used for measuring continuous values and it is used where zero has any arbitrary function like temperature. the last is ratio which is again used for measuring continuous but in this zero has a meaning like height weight or salary. then we learned that in y =f(x): y is the label and x is called features. supervised learning is when we have both labels and features available. phenomenal and ordinal levels of we use classification and for interval and ratio level of measurement we use regression. when why is not known then we use unsupervised learning under which comes k means clustering and hierarchical clustering like we have only x and which is spreaded into clusters and from that we try to predict y using some ml techniques. the last thing we learned was the difference between sample and population sample is the data we have access to and population is the total amount of data and however the large amount of data we have access to it is always the sample for us and never the

510,"in today's lecture we discussed that given a dataset, we can use various methods to make predictions of certain parameters using tools like simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, etc. we also discussed that we will move back and forth between ml and statistics in this course as they are closely related. then we had a look at levels a measurement (4 levels) which are nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio. nominal and ordinal are discrete while interval and ratio are continuos. there is no ordering in nominal measurement we can always assign numbers to the categories say for example male=0 and female=1. this comes with a very fundamental problem, it allows ordering because 0<1. we discussed a solution to this and it was by the use of vectors. we then had a look at 'interval' and understood how we cannot compare 10 degree c to be twice as 5 degree c because of its dependency on a reference. we then took a look at 'ratio' which allows us such comparisons. we discussed the use of 'levels of measurements' in 'ml category' as nominal and ordinal being useful for 'classification' and interval and ratio being useful for 'regression'. then we moved to the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning which essentially was the presence and absence of labels respectively. there are various models for unsupervised learning like k-means clustering, hierarchial clustering. we concluded our lecture with the difference between population and sample while talking about the duality of lack of data and abundance of data for a computer to

513,"in the class, i learned about the four levels of measurement: nominal (discrete, classification, e.g., gender or color), ordinal (discrete, classification, e.g., grades), interval (continuous, regression, e.g., temperature), and ratio (continuous, regression with a true zero). i explored the concept of a label as y = f(x), where x is the features vector, and unsupervised learning methods like k-means and hierarchical clustering. additionally, the idea of a sample as a subset of a population for analysis was discussed.",0.013161936,0.01092003,-0.04288257,0.022592539,0.03367503,0.04166468,0.014337397,-0.0018977405,0.055520874,0.006118674,0.011376479,-0.054469664,-0.0067251613,0.043173663,-0.011455929,-0.059236426,0.043596383,0.051187616,0.004664116,-0.027807752,0.018347684,-0.024353368,0.14297901,0.062713325,-0.014442549,0.034318324,-0.034779374,-0.014917525,-0.014958907,0.030948967,-0.026585305,0.11136951,0.049571227,-0.0005969215,-0.035409622,0.038583092,0.08033698,0.07776158,-0.067660294,0.10960926,0.0012753925,0.0027629212,0.018105637,0.07580815,0.009194013,0.08193948,-0.026287671,-0.07098982,-0.10144893,0.037616283,0.0130827725,0.05722713,-0.08033648,0.053988397,-0.025984155,0.03643149,0.031052127,-0.034011357,-0.0067790663,0.082179755,-0.029045684,-0.031462878,-0.062101867,0.032874826,0.026717177,0.0689112,-0.064740896,0.025265543,0.016459364,0.009128057,0.038781572,0.06726938,0.011157681,0.07435169,0.03988159,-0.06000652,0.019608052,-0.0012641265,0.051270355,0.058512706,-0.04097603,0.05537408,-0.015657105,0.027605498,0.07010225,-0.035878956,0.03285139,-0.06574252,-0.122783095,0.0048391935,-0.014334066,0.05252579,-0.030958094,0.013493661,-0.024496336,-0.04524024,0.0061460966,-0.07944041,0.12430197,0.0026829545,-0.026590604,0.024211725,-0.014159104,0.014984005,-0.040351696,-0.08799299,-0.009214001,-0.009870236,0.07372302,-0.038408905,-0.07234332,-0.044499926,-0.09131663,-0.020594548,0.03819162,-0.050232068,0.024670117,0.0020081818,0.015982755,-0.00713447,-0.040589884,-0.01961548,0.028127747,-0.0028234224,0.06796674,0.060903493,-0.040027093,-4.566175e-33,0.023218265,-0.06692475,-0.02603318,0.036885045,-0.031041803,-0.0037484767,-0.03846514,0.019628998,0.14003763,0.082157604,0.071418196,0.12008213,-0.005204478,0.092357025,0.12400959,0.017192295,-0.03173611,0.10360965,-0.032533597,-0.041531645,-0.04715992,0.008126853,0.04705956,-0.028958865,-0.0068550254,0.028633123,-0.06740804,0.022764517,-0.0046299077,-0.004094478,-0.0072945463,0.01741104,-0.018562473,-0.03837884,-0.035479505,-0.033311024,0.04192105,0.012766928,-0.010970689,-0.03892678,-0.002406802,-0.06485323,0.15296035,-0.09653353,0.008823246,0.057152543,-0.034369227,0.004066027,-0.03171278,0.0132222045,-0.10148679,-0.12581827,0.05577852,-0.070761085,-0.02983439,0.09604988,-0.0547281,-0.016969118,-0.11050466,-0.062266596,-0.027042834,0.022491403,0.018510424,-0.040662892,0.015297096,0.019768748,-0.031670004,-0.053209256,0.07385975,-0.029541824,-0.02963326,0.028992342,-0.10834209,-0.019416176,0.017558975,0.027570259,-0.019249395,0.033006452,-0.03785582,0.033555675,0.0037149356,-0.04489598,-0.010525828,-0.051043827,-0.017218709,0.039951257,0.021602403,-0.08084615,0.03150478,-0.04877649,-0.13647318,-0.011016816,-0.04727084,0.02056259,-0.027409246,-2.187706e-35,-0.06318007,0.048179995,-0.051478878,0.02398511,-0.00574759,0.021480247,0.027259875,0.054240964,0.0077341427,0.016312147,-0.059763096,0.016873982,-0.007680639,-0.008284622,-0.031682465,0.059730712,-0.11494679,-0.0462095,-0.012249075,0.03113221,-0.06985212,0.024461761,-0.03419657,-0.011204088,0.003223109,0.009990253,0.0024231763,0.0022566551,-0.015601487,-0.0020823062,-0.020508485,-0.13066144,0.030043013,-0.03623668,-0.014661217,-0.03520185,0.074070595,-0.044225175,-0.03520473,0.026632076,-0.016307764,0.03875466,-0.016762495,-0.011902954,0.0042189914,-0.06911645,0.071617074,0.02116667,-0.050910484,0.010852348,-0.020573758,0.045830566,-0.0058540814,-0.0010040102,-0.011710643,0.015643742,-0.03978783,-0.041020203,0.0205403,0.09506432,0.029077653,-0.056880645,-0.03154454,0.093352415,-0.059035864,-0.041393165,-0.013571944,0.027133524,-0.093938045,-0.02035683,0.0026057067,0.00030753395,0.0032778385,-0.05036743,-0.09083725,-0.10121946,-0.055945124,-0.01310578,-0.095215045,0.04067158,-0.003834055,-0.069952354,-0.06532824,0.054412555,0.020858176,-0.05687264,0.072965406,0.023859585,0.060899165,-0.07483724,0.014496849,0.015858827,-0.108486064,0.040704787,-0.07830277,-5.6713027e-08,-0.03270985,0.03262841,0.07153538,-0.016563684,0.028072258,0.041876886,-0.013703397,0.053146813,-0.08534426,0.05910016,0.04625381,0.040042825,-0.11531282,-0.0053699245,0.020787684,-0.050098207,0.08599448,0.08705795,0.010958765,0.052924275,0.05084126,-0.027821608,-0.0101021435,-0.026648253,0.032278117,-0.06283189,0.06762508,0.024564896,0.054430895,-0.0030920825,-0.03114897,0.10241697,0.022089418,-0.014912503,0.009238045,0.12543818,-0.049240183,0.0013497034,-0.021607876,-0.04446554,-0.08474675,-0.049206294,-0.034406178,0.04131371,0.05548563,0.0153406225,-0.027914006,0.03954621,0.04510966,0.064763226,-0.0771341,0.06294651,-0.0359942,0.036989406,0.020864958,0.0012166154,-0.03695559,-0.06351428,-0.07133791,0.03308938,0.09498409,0.052644473,-0.066769846,-0.017844783,3,24.1798,-16.008688,3

554,"in today's class, we discussed levels of measurement for data, which include four types: 1) nominal, 2) ordinal, 3) interval, and 4) ratio. of these, nominal and ordinal are categorical data, while interval and ratio are numerical data.

nominal data has no inherent order among categories. examples include gender and nationality. ordinal data, on the other hand, is categorical with an inherent order but lacks meaningful intervals between categories, such as grades (a, b, c). for nominal and ordinal data, techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding are used for feature representation. however, one-hot encoding can significantly increase the dimensionality of the dataset.

interval and ratio data are both continuous and numerical. interval data, such as temperature in â°c or â°f, has an arbitrary zero, meaning zero does not represent the absence of the quantity. in contrast, ratio data has an absolute zero, as in the case of temperature in kelvin (0k) or height, where zero indicates the complete absence of the quantity.

we also covered the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning. in supervised learning, the target variable (y) is provided, and the goal is to learn a function f that maps input features (x) to the output (y). techniques like linear regression and multiple regression are examples. in unsupervised learning, the target variable is not available, and the focus is on finding patterns in the data, such as clustering based on distance metrics like euclidean distance. examples include k-means and hierarchical clustering.

finally, we discussed the distinction between population and samples. all the data available on the internet represents samples of a larger population. machine learning models are trained on these samples and generalized to the population using proper validation techniques.",0.014349149,-0.044700354,-0.03614235,0.05078194,0.019386897,0.03577647,-0.09837641,-0.098268785,0.040873148,-0.051277477,0.022577029,-0.077797525,0.018158741,0.03248827,0.07118761,-0.031066602,0.072527595,0.033135515,-0.0760346,-0.06624494,0.052995134,0.0051042326,-0.014511614,0.04138843,0.0145413745,-0.033437904,-0.028922752,0.032597084,-0.020391319,0.027622977,-0.04403259,0.05155009,-0.0024709757,0.027113922,-0.06522325,-0.039546728,0.048810754,0.034383845,-0.07468776,0.029496014,-0.033203233,-0.032816984,0.040216543,0.07894223,0.050122194,0.098609604,-0.0766544,-0.024444923,-0.13278145,-0.0062706377,-0.027247468,0.04600854,-0.021305868,0.10824323,-0.07091562,0.03826536,-0.014036684,0.0016154557,-0.007262812,0.013308134,-0.1542013,-0.008140839,-0.01426747,-0.020094154,-0.0013417442,-0.08062833,-0.02454282,0.0045491,0.025701694,0.05191781,0.03532325,0.04098194,-0.03691403,0.053497504,0.021515526,-0.03755327,0.026088905,-0.01463242,0.091132075,0.015973322,-0.036661178,0.014090398,0.0029163186,0.056695078,0.06369149,-0.07380799,0.074064754,0.044381347,-0.10709305,0.057801522,-0.014434399,0.04103439,0.042541314,-0.0032923585,0.019398434,-0.021142017,0.035194907,0.012098672,0.0483288,-0.030089868,-0.0318335,-0.015815558,-0.10367524,0.020361938,0.030983975,-0.046524853,0.04288357,-0.0047033313,0.12953988,-0.062558964,-0.019791463,-0.01142274,-0.10251473,-0.08348276,-0.006658061,-0.061429173,-0.030019,0.023201216,0.040426012,-0.031505194,-0.02423215,-0.014220055,0.026993172,0.07833002,0.014695846,-0.036251694,-0.030504256,2.6860858e-33,-0.022769395,-0.057550035,-0.07481159,-0.007371834,4.6136134e-05,-0.029276136,-0.09811969,0.041360192,0.09779639,0.089131914,-0.0011101807,0.10555589,-0.019263893,0.108212635,0.08251832,0.0027067456,0.050591126,0.08014316,-0.07929687,-0.035642996,-0.010960982,0.057897136,0.07063998,0.028406037,0.032369923,-0.0034545034,-0.041090038,-0.020839214,-0.06333641,0.010313922,-0.04774154,-0.043306418,-0.005666269,-0.035790037,-0.025617627,-0.06313662,0.030428875,0.022418158,0.049798694,0.016193807,0.009148446,-0.01134511,0.07772219,-0.05031684,0.043800704,0.03641661,0.035787772,0.033525273,-0.07618386,-0.010235863,-0.023233034,-0.008224076,0.04170337,-0.053821575,-0.009534825,0.010500048,0.04018365,-0.029356895,-0.101855755,-0.005304461,-0.11387391,0.04372974,0.09635367,-0.060081813,-0.012123311,-0.012265376,-0.006820366,-0.012953992,0.071523525,0.021884156,-0.013680472,0.08894469,-0.04458675,-0.035086833,-0.025280282,0.046453975,0.05384897,-0.021810655,-0.037162524,0.06417192,-0.0034088355,-0.047980428,0.054232627,-0.05180281,-0.06671629,-0.036354817,0.027443975,-0.015816536,0.05902307,-0.0632849,-0.092783436,-0.0020322036,0.018273706,0.0009906512,0.05244598,-4.0482934e-33,-0.064593494,0.030779747,-0.056480087,0.020032777,-0.06795145,0.003027615,0.00773496,0.03182536,0.03279135,-0.0020997042,-0.004580348,-0.03686403,-0.043954622,-0.054423023,-0.010048792,0.025801212,-0.14065872,0.019571848,-0.0559872,0.09254138,-0.039107718,0.051310215,-0.100875385,0.050302904,-0.005767426,0.021886094,-0.021634286,0.0015766828,-0.019212438,0.033758357,-0.014077399,-0.09461942,0.0042175073,-0.08133882,-0.00080204406,-0.022888698,0.043206535,-0.07235332,-0.026380677,0.095694505,0.031457625,0.049256913,-0.005095274,0.023195662,0.0036581054,-0.030754646,0.018086541,0.011941324,0.018296987,0.016525295,0.06715047,0.029020011,0.024249803,0.031546496,0.046501044,-0.021714386,-0.058514558,-0.051964957,0.0039879223,0.06304812,0.0007501607,-0.040315636,0.057091624,0.04502699,-0.07728296,-0.021218274,0.026653484,0.017342906,-0.05310677,-0.07068467,0.061448295,0.030873017,0.032364175,-0.027563727,-0.11691323,-0.07282713,0.012669694,0.018673025,-0.055003434,0.033043507,-0.00375483,-0.023797834,-0.04390194,0.08840306,0.028508509,0.03294266,0.1000776,0.007643001,0.0475038,-0.03491818,-0.0066792606,0.08428301,-0.08677765,0.09602698,-0.024643017,-5.167343e-08,-0.056020536,-0.01380153,0.01765178,-0.032502394,0.046273522,0.012822008,-0.048241794,0.040709086,-0.012483343,0.065449506,0.09585499,0.048981532,-0.083121255,-0.052357312,0.06508199,0.0007570317,0.08884787,-0.050142594,0.052622125,0.04726137,0.031398192,0.032028828,-0.03975158,-0.095258996,0.012816451,-0.05137271,-0.028167848,0.15881903,0.06380936,0.00977673,-0.018997245,0.025161484,0.03127598,0.0077804625,0.06275682,0.049605712,0.031410158,0.02480627,-0.08066383,-0.067289606,0.012769331,-0.009290799,-0.04621887,-0.0001240732,0.03033991,-0.060186155,0.024892813,-0.0029002305,0.026383504,0.08428804,-0.07987515,0.054784752,-0.023723645,0.026480272,0.019186731,-0.02109445,-0.07357838,-0.04009431,-0.035243157,0.024965147,0.12408566,-0.022111889,-0.09594607,-0.031947803,3,27.60811,-10.905636,3

591,"the lecture was focused on various key concepts in data measurement and machine learning. it began with the levels of measurement, which include nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio levels. nominal scales categorize data without any order, while ordinal scales add meaningful order but lack measurable distances. interval scales offer numeric measurement with equal intervals but no true zero, and ratio scales provide both equal intervals and a true zero, enabling magnitude comparison.
the lecture distinguished between supervised and unsupervised learning. supervised learning involves labeled data where the dependent variable is known, and examples include regression and classification techniques. in contrast, unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, focusing on clustering methods such as k-means and hierarchical clustering to identify patterns within the data.
the discussion on regression covered various types, including single linear regression, multiple regression, logistic regression, polynomial regression, and random forest models. 
the lecture also touched upon the concepts of population and sample data, stressing the need for a representative sample in data analysis",-0.028124025,-0.038897455,-0.022394551,0.100092225,0.09224523,0.031425867,-0.035872683,-0.05048046,-0.002689584,-0.0047808485,0.014917773,-0.043236908,-0.0016698499,-0.001050737,-0.024485385,-0.05492681,0.038044095,-0.030410733,-0.017993499,-0.046787426,0.084425844,0.017210511,0.045444723,0.09962961,0.024350163,0.0032743649,0.020234125,0.007668844,-0.0021745297,0.01272014,-0.011533754,0.03978778,0.042606965,0.047566943,-0.0703993,0.0003946351,0.060483582,0.11349234,-0.07622355,0.062129106,-0.013841684,-0.018859522,0.0034859402,0.007766926,0.039051753,0.037225675,-0.11033956,-0.005226896,-0.13620603,0.011735588,-0.02196762,-0.008577387,-0.05898876,0.04705116,-0.03716982,0.027487364,0.04529901,0.011899644,0.044003025,0.013046863,-0.027258277,-0.10615316,-0.04654451,-0.011136848,-0.028242009,0.023828452,-0.059671555,0.047118835,-6.817332e-05,-0.02867176,-0.004106165,0.02675657,-0.018437663,0.108401544,0.049625468,-0.05338583,0.0053082276,0.018245436,0.06435697,0.049453966,-0.046792563,0.06340567,-0.007385556,0.04030799,0.08005401,-0.0232807,0.04891379,-0.004812282,-0.06040483,0.032440998,-0.011844031,0.046021875,-0.04325795,0.018632554,-0.043085426,-0.07081067,0.002633676,-0.05107425,0.10458322,0.022468386,-0.02490273,0.10001341,-0.024362907,-0.01171297,-0.041552395,-0.019325387,-0.046790663,-0.04483687,0.10403942,0.005682257,-0.016671328,0.009994532,-0.10565884,0.003604369,0.002473507,-0.05551293,0.09567221,0.012719964,-0.037354376,0.02519402,0.018752767,-0.030525086,0.013836258,0.054002456,0.069717504,-0.011285255,-0.064908355,2.686812e-33,-0.0127563495,-0.10753593,0.030771276,-0.03761477,-0.00063887227,-0.059670065,-0.09167228,0.009936967,0.08741512,0.09103369,0.07437113,0.11340331,0.019888302,0.09827561,0.0756849,0.023943113,0.06606905,0.093688436,-0.052762233,-0.08496346,0.0087816315,0.0076314043,-0.0030203108,-0.042981606,-0.04129336,0.026722373,-0.03745097,0.0058620456,0.020434717,0.0011749838,0.0035507188,-0.013291115,-0.04760874,0.0060665268,0.018159099,0.0083550755,0.0139581645,-0.035970517,0.052919813,-0.0196224,-0.018314667,-0.027090298,0.12427851,-0.14011423,0.02898283,0.0023166449,0.044467464,-0.023234168,0.015392976,-0.032925863,-0.049283065,-0.0825789,0.015997326,-0.030922115,-0.046161555,0.13282748,-0.0010685374,-0.036707193,-0.06941461,0.0035979394,-0.048160855,-0.059461735,0.020304723,-0.025254454,-0.013176048,-0.03631549,-0.049927257,0.027680693,0.042523246,-0.0011752328,-0.023848463,0.05873906,-0.029776122,0.023758605,-0.008068293,0.06159679,0.013482222,0.047638252,-0.055569608,0.036043726,0.006718354,-0.010925369,-0.024946522,-0.07398909,-0.03598381,0.03159307,0.008512808,-0.04065434,0.0034343777,-0.060245898,-0.12678432,0.033414982,-0.057919525,-0.0021803856,0.03420442,-4.8668453e-33,-0.012119237,0.020055782,-0.029270524,0.025166865,-0.0010014367,0.07554288,-0.024684386,0.0733331,0.01060838,-0.08193929,-0.06345655,0.015721336,0.053830437,0.04027427,0.010108649,0.093858376,-0.08360988,0.028887106,-0.044193745,0.030219695,-0.011085822,0.01956694,0.0017493508,-0.013348463,0.0020298818,-0.037690096,-0.01543312,0.04930774,-0.053759966,0.04223048,0.021506172,-0.086370446,0.0015546592,-0.094351955,-0.01457995,-0.0177728,0.014338186,-0.094582826,-0.043694984,0.043480366,0.0038219003,0.071893156,-0.032438695,-0.07160465,0.023985457,-0.095094815,0.05223746,-0.0033903462,-0.012144337,-0.017822051,-0.069782846,0.057461973,0.02898248,0.01662399,-0.028043265,0.0019022068,-0.04709803,-0.014120827,0.03897989,0.008993109,0.027198914,-0.010054731,-0.043670423,0.08823727,-0.076162696,-0.08885204,0.044341605,0.009673612,-0.08395751,-0.012913621,-0.06904214,0.0116134,0.0728732,-0.06540791,-0.11869453,-0.06251478,-0.015513827,-0.012556014,-0.07004028,-0.00078931305,0.054729205,-0.069573775,-0.07627412,0.0680884,0.06990152,0.006656153,0.12204956,0.030733122,0.06146317,-0.0149952145,-0.022627648,0.051590543,-0.0756109,0.032554366,-0.053836804,-4.825026e-08,-0.053917166,-0.0032412075,0.021281743,-0.020568974,0.038155906,0.0069048894,-0.029957453,0.07669171,-0.120203845,0.055210132,0.090232834,-0.023720162,-0.10001401,0.030738045,0.014918091,0.02885537,0.13280919,0.031655677,0.007686046,0.044440556,-0.0062285583,-0.036398504,-0.0014504922,0.0071733044,0.07030527,-0.10967659,0.049068306,0.0895609,0.013359781,-0.014585138,-0.03095393,0.09837158,0.05053571,-0.008905407,0.035050582,0.1353519,-0.025198938,0.02484599,-0.03164502,-0.071125425,-0.0016585651,0.03312299,-0.021854078,0.04612941,0.054410324,0.037684947,0.019991899,0.02498394,0.00927829,-0.013036218,-0.022069123,0.035849366,-0.004493708,0.04661388,0.04198806,0.07064255,-0.054594245,-0.06309911,0.009980376,0.005264433,0.104590006,-0.03910891,-0.067774065,-0.024993896,3,22.337091,-14.646312,3
595,"we explored how empirical equations were traditionally used in the past and how modern machine learning algorithms have now taken their place. we also learned about the levels of measurement, namely nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio, along with the encoding methods for ordinal data. additionally, we discussed the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, particularly how predictions are made in the absence of label information. the session further covered key concepts such as data, population, and sample, emphasizing their importance in analysis and

610," the class started with an emphasis on how closely related ml and statistics are. it was told that machine learning is all about finding 'f' in  y = f(x).then we learnt about 4 levels of measures, which determines the kind of ml problem to be solved. they are nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio. nominal is categorical, no order, discrete. ordinal is similar but each of the category has got an order. interval is continuous, there is no fixed zero(can change with context), ratio of these intervals can't be interpreted. ratio similar to interval, with a fixed zero, where both difference and ratio makes sense. it was explained why learning these measures was important as it helps understand supervised ml algorithms. any ml problem where y is either nominal or ordinal is a classification problem and if it is else, it is a regression problem. in unsupervised learning one has to bring out patterns from the data, mostly clustering similar ones. the discussion went on to  how using numbers to represent categories in nominal and ordinal causes problems and how one hot encoding, which basically vectorizes the labels solves it. then an idea about what statistics was discussed. it is a study that aims to better understand the population, studying a smaller subset of it - sample.",-0.03397611,-0.036094304,-0.032551147,0.022796419,0.02688195,0.075431675,-0.0778602,-0.030831112,-0.007490978,0.011043937,0.015053286,0.009434579,0.00028496693,0.0132118985,-0.032826573,-0.035997156,0.043523096,0.004980714,-0.1391428,0.010306841,0.028510148,0.020234222,0.03263539,0.06053419,-0.030433724,0.011063671,0.012251658,-0.022323305,0.0097081205,0.024926307,-0.0008703796,0.076259896,0.05156042,0.014350131,-0.111848295,-0.04673339,0.09807193,0.04016336,-0.042375136,0.06718997,-0.046965342,-0.054046568,0.021490658,0.01229883,0.03830327,0.05860262,-0.06316876,-0.08875378,-0.085080564,-0.010553015,-0.03190103,0.032480653,-0.07789289,0.0015122918,-0.037578616,0.03841955,0.030567683,-0.0058119437,-0.021144249,0.008078025,-0.10516833,-0.098005354,-0.02764466,0.00089374575,-0.021733228,-0.048468966,-0.020961404,0.024852581,0.052413285,0.06412394,0.01692156,0.04929573,-0.036448345,0.06537442,0.0651768,0.006450867,0.017539084,0.0023696625,0.04256435,0.008615562,0.023443492,0.06683851,0.031585786,0.06492451,0.0594565,-0.07125599,-0.0125836665,0.008799482,-0.06631331,-0.02039158,0.029690262,0.023326095,-0.033578917,0.030964952,0.06153502,-0.0124638155,-0.044278678,0.0056908634,0.10688152,-0.010109184,-0.02693423,0.030352244,-0.059274375,-0.028761702,-0.012163718,-0.052537657,0.049422145,0.026696602,0.07247051,-0.06464784,-0.014240631,-0.052156445,-0.08580924,-0.010250167,-0.03894527,-0.0701663,0.018906154,0.009112494,0.049590856,-0.00041775883,0.02809258,0.005059534,-0.035114862,0.06548886,0.035937414,0.038131215,-0.079206064,2.8596225e-33,-0.017611276,-0.051420145,-0.034609392,0.044468157,0.047402672,-0.04931761,-0.03635388,0.006415715,0.14713563,0.054956403,0.046487384,0.116975464,-0.0017622294,0.033152614,0.06333032,-0.0032875885,0.05305741,0.0084106745,-0.07627716,-0.0884919,0.03151974,0.06887545,0.085822955,-0.04004313,0.0039529474,0.08856152,-0.04998572,-0.04337421,0.022750393,0.0249638,-0.022143437,0.003979295,-0.051220663,-0.00328498,0.046014324,-0.02587175,0.058136355,-0.02256272,0.021813916,-0.020887295,-0.029906813,0.009114377,0.057195935,-0.08572577,0.012312143,0.057063293,0.027218478,0.012041559,0.011430443,-0.021529416,-0.054263752,-0.055929974,0.055560753,-0.07432561,0.010237853,0.03780894,-0.030632505,0.0070050983,-0.12743166,-0.004375898,-0.051162902,0.020251237,0.10292786,-0.037744656,-0.011885051,-0.0010408412,-0.0077463514,0.01868967,0.052567806,0.0031102644,0.013237427,0.08145976,-0.10231712,-0.06365153,-0.0071819793,0.048636515,0.016873488,-0.0040460886,-0.074758835,0.056128226,0.0098570585,-0.052073,0.018380702,-0.07735851,-0.095532656,-0.010051135,0.08901466,0.015114714,0.054612074,-0.06813651,-0.03659886,-0.04090955,-0.018362358,0.024388297,0.05463751,-6.2821056e-33,-0.07108954,0.049629763,-0.09074914,-0.009645365,-0.070058,0.034426775,-0.04570739,0.029333197,0.041385103,-0.019026311,-0.06766857,0.0053391336,-0.04658014,-0.02104582,-0.03924782,-0.017829321,-0.0658201,-0.009839633,-0.10340862,0.056056708,0.027941767,0.062118396,-0.09261156,-0.061110675,0.0049525327,0.05383159,-0.0349252,0.015386538,-0.061649185,0.062752604,0.03850772,-0.05732646,0.01802632,-0.06023027,-0.0025992796,-0.008338763,0.016165234,-0.042176645,-0.033637594,0.024640147,0.04633464,-0.019241782,0.01874868,-0.09615737,0.054157734,-0.017450264,0.036686003,0.0043616467,0.018695688,-0.02385167,0.047002587,0.053714857,0.018784529,0.02994025,-0.0052111945,0.002071059,-0.048933174,-0.076507375,-0.0056092995,0.08596747,0.028567621,-0.02473262,-0.023288885,0.042868745,-0.09462686,0.011969189,0.010281162,0.0031811013,-0.045329425,-0.06634696,-0.046178244,0.030306116,0.027188119,0.011625076,-0.14196365,-0.026970806,-0.04199604,-0.005117543,-0.07277147,0.03159232,-0.017862432,-0.1068218,-0.054998975,0.04998486,0.0038970164,-0.007297884,0.1526131,0.039333444,0.0496269,-0.085865386,0.0033182916,0.00560709,-0.07081402,0.057875734,-0.017864421,-6.227692e-08,-0.04960728,0.002812886,-0.007213503,-0.007799855,0.06930539,0.052038003,-0.09663689,0.066306725,-0.049894616,0.16237776,0.0035948053,0.05097761,-0.06769062,-0.03749717,-0.022718748,0.010066976,0.085280545,-0.0077369176,0.03151329,0.05811253,0.068366244,-0.04278942,0.0029966421,-0.06675814,-0.021538502,-0.0566289,0.03696788,0.077323705,0.04824814,-0.0024003594,-0.09624018,0.050301585,0.0063788057,0.012825093,0.01490199,0.10178234,0.022582425,-0.061124854,-0.055483278,-0.11337364,-0.021117713,-0.018633641,-0.010254153,0.022491297,0.074125834,0.0069490853,0.0023173513,0.060141254,-0.0006977622,0.108644605,-0.06078035,0.10466484,-0.0075842203,0.059076943,0.018305643,-0.017483838,-0.04103466,-0.08393301,-0.09980155,0.030607786,0.08596806,0.049053542,-0.05100943,-0.0089358,3,26.35337,-14.3873005,3
620,"we started by acknowledging the base of data science, y=f(x). that is finding the relation between features and labels. following up we were told about a few algorithms, named: simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, random forest, and logistic regression. 
there was a discussion on measurements and their types, named: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.
we also talked about encoding of data, and how and when we should not use number directly. finally, we had a peek into the part of ml with no label, ie unsupervised learning, and some of the techniques used,",0.043795794,-0.03332682,-0.06807358,0.027389953,0.0777656,0.033820312,-0.044004362,-0.033735678,-0.0025491163,-0.020460378,0.013816213,-0.015138335,-0.0077459286,0.047065724,-0.0041100183,0.03328586,0.019086668,0.030881956,-0.0036942651,-0.034508444,0.0028391988,0.033599176,0.03410725,0.07386579,0.043571115,0.025828322,-0.06205807,-0.04426272,0.008061565,0.008846128,-0.0007490282,0.071155526,0.055317104,-0.0036312595,-0.090894885,-0.0020950923,0.054896284,0.0327546,0.0021304504,0.035262477,-0.020994946,-0.082542,0.026756456,0.048880037,0.03769148,0.10909245,-0.040678203,-0.053075157,-0.07226695,0.08322733,-0.07211109,0.0052295625,-0.08153772,0.03681934,-0.020722698,-0.011270907,0.04162717,0.004636778,0.00025350272,0.08230404,-0.045238502,-0.015612994,-0.05241222,0.04399287,-0.01259755,0.015230065,-0.027541425,-0.0048058894,0.020256987,0.021707704,0.033418335,0.07120387,0.010924819,0.047265332,0.040421814,0.009555187,0.03499467,0.018013852,0.044891644,0.042826016,-0.048973996,0.085438006,-0.018230263,0.08779329,0.05684106,-0.03887377,1.849587e-05,0.021791961,-0.08196159,-0.023197532,-0.0026675155,-0.018509319,-0.024450876,0.015829634,-0.017415585,-0.016811892,0.013882248,-0.03683416,0.058808513,-0.00075816555,-0.08339359,0.047253538,-0.020704415,-0.012633762,0.01029844,-0.05859348,0.03868474,-0.03649129,0.096110456,-0.07604497,-0.00360162,-0.01991916,-0.088852055,-0.036940888,0.04079491,-0.10279552,0.014601365,-0.031985812,0.04424261,-0.019382048,-0.05481306,-0.008636926,0.006370033,-0.0016315029,-0.016086038,0.07071059,-0.08478554,-1.4697999e-33,0.0053796084,-0.017177287,-0.0109841805,0.050424002,-0.017454248,-0.067189775,-0.016423404,-0.010898493,0.12992021,0.09053095,0.09255645,0.10661935,0.015239887,0.069059335,0.08352217,-0.052037418,0.030259974,0.04516197,-0.02608354,-0.078908324,0.012842499,0.03290173,0.057648793,-0.049561813,0.0146998055,0.018920047,-0.105057046,-0.029597292,0.03271172,0.004424135,0.009027458,0.016080996,0.021605438,0.007547295,0.00025258856,-0.049787298,-0.00070985337,-0.024565617,0.02163548,0.016970646,0.009558114,0.004433303,0.032683372,-0.12251132,0.030912368,0.056725558,-0.004472675,-0.041436777,0.0090688635,-0.036027115,-0.06448315,-0.07407724,-0.0189839,-0.042222578,-0.014127177,0.09899274,-0.07598865,-0.024876935,-0.12953332,0.0020440046,-0.060160078,0.021992372,0.11361056,-0.07431969,-0.050562162,0.03953131,0.011063421,-0.03564405,0.047014985,-0.033837184,-0.03422263,0.063444905,-0.07713677,-0.05822121,0.039008696,0.012080608,-0.0005544595,-0.061577555,-0.01951552,0.07220136,-0.0022683614,-0.017183365,0.014899812,-0.0123740835,-0.008625042,0.01483241,-0.01947356,-0.032301314,0.015432424,-0.061666206,-0.10474646,0.026160527,-0.035829965,-0.0041330513,0.029085768,-2.326647e-33,-0.11050303,0.023053335,-0.028340584,0.01965021,-0.051432278,-0.0044746324,-0.0052827355,0.01557085,0.023568433,0.02017754,-0.04088598,-0.03891987,-0.03516466,-0.002495376,-0.06466496,0.0012269637,-0.095023915,-0.0058507924,-0.08562368,0.04755657,-0.005454416,0.11312689,-0.10747281,-0.05250694,0.05230758,0.0064416123,0.00028940645,0.004996669,-0.027356517,0.027079241,-0.04616617,-0.07351858,0.039305285,-0.09653921,-0.014966911,0.0094423015,0.055676073,-0.047996707,-0.03871608,-9.24528e-06,0.010905698,0.04106921,-0.005045756,-0.073074855,-0.009931672,-0.086474955,0.001988826,-0.0032033178,0.019652689,0.025134774,0.037128158,0.018633986,-0.081708625,-0.03627583,0.006877122,-0.0030062303,-0.046692707,-0.0030193944,0.02162423,0.0781681,-0.020678058,-0.020872546,-0.005972472,0.057811964,-0.06862347,-0.019763405,0.00442645,0.033026654,-0.07937164,-0.072757214,0.020364692,0.0598529,-0.007838246,0.044454556,-0.14152552,-0.048725665,-0.03354531,-0.05674262,-0.08733174,0.04196756,0.09990458,-0.07981147,-0.024973966,0.084318474,0.019385856,0.006603134,0.09281211,-0.02673,-0.004374567,-0.09723826,-0.026633551,-0.0017878913,-0.14425878,0.114660524,-0.026768193,-5.5393855e-08,-0.07141971,-0.009647571,0.06292297,-0.022615744,0.056645848,0.10356349,-0.031652153,0.0942336,-0.06198691,0.070934996,0.03547132,0.0378952,-0.10683131,0.021884164,0.045613825,-0.04297806,0.11506848,0.049925197,0.025204599,0.047782443,0.033410303,-0.013898513,0.029523268,-0.09201161,0.073149025,-0.0927761,0.037636545,0.08736033,0.026250545,-0.0031691026,-0.05782217,0.039011244,-0.0052259113,0.011639362,0.03824546,0.13912538,0.022254312,-0.0637249,-0.070837,-0.053429544,-0.05371875,0.07692028,-0.012999188,0.0056195003,0.06825403,0.10973446,0.03426424,0.056778014,-0.011705433,0.058010124,-0.011552764,0.010932423,0.048108757,0.008377203,0.068096355,0.019844316,-0.035145182,-0.040189188,-0.050281513,0.055585615,0.068225294,0.044146847,0.03289965,-0.04855019,3,22.392183,-16.181755,3
621,"data has levels of measurement. there are 4 levels of measurement:
1. nominal: they are descrete and there is no ordering between data categories. eg colour, gender 
2. ordinal: they are descrete, but unlike nominal, they have ordering between data categories. eg grades
3. interval: they are continuous. eg temperature, height 
4. ratio: those which can be expressed as one is x times of another. measurement of unit should not matter. eg height can be categorised as ratio level of measurement, but temperature can not. 

from the given data, we may be interested in identifying underlying distribution. y = f(x). where x is data and y is label. when y is descrete, the required task is named as classification and when y is continuous, it's called as regression. nominal and ordinal data are used in classification task, whereas interval and ratio are used in regression task. 

while learning the underlying distribution and data is nominal, we are required to convert it into numerical values. in such case, we use one hot encoding.

660,"we learnt about different ml techniques such as simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, logistic regression, k-means clustering. we learned about the levels of measurement. they are of 4 types: 1)nominal : in this categorization without a specific order is done and it is discrete. for eg.: gender, colour. 2) ordinal : in this categorization is done in ordered way without equal intervals and it is discrete. for eg.: grades, rankings 3) interval : in this categorization, it is ordered with equal intervals but no true zero. it is continuous in nature. for eg.: temperature. 4) ratio: this categorization is similar to the interval, just here the the zero is true zero. for eg.: height, weight. next, we learned about the general type of equal in ml : y =f(x), where y is label and x are features. if both of them are known then it is known as supervised learning. if labels are unknown, it is called unsupervised learning and then using k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering, we create labels for
