12,"in today's session, we first analyzed the summaries we write after every class using the pivot table in excel, in which we see the number of people who submitted the summary, the average word length of summaries, the minimum number of characters in any summary and the maximum number of character in any summary. we plot the data collected through summaries into a histogram, which tells about the shape of the data, and then the box plot to further analyze the data. we find the descriptive statistics of the data and scatter plots of data points. we also see how many times a person has submitted the summary, and then we plot the changes in the summary over time, including changes in maximum words and minimum words in the summaries. then, we also analyzed other data with different columns of data, and at last, we plotted the data, including the outliers. at the end of the class, we got the assessment of exercise 2 by the teaching assistant, including some points which are as follows: proper naming of files; proper plots with titles, labeling, and legend; excel file submission as (.xlsx) form and not (.csv) as they don't contain the formulas we have used for performing the data analysis; formatting the document in a proper format; providing examples if asked; using a spreadsheet if mentioned, making all the necessary plots and calculating correct descriptive statistics; adding residual diagnostics, talking about all the metrics obtained and not just r^2; creating a dataset with large variance; rmse, f-statistic, r^2 vs std. dev. plots; mentioning the ci interval also with the description about it.",0.031702444,0.04804754,-0.02748983,-0.033460762,-0.057592064,0.041307606,-0.030678568,0.08282366,0.06354237,0.04435285,0.020136047,0.03236867,0.078106,0.006985753,-0.051713087,-0.012990391,0.0357201,-0.03190193,-0.05192532,-0.03164443,0.041438818,0.010931542,0.0106789265,0.015100369,0.09278126,0.06439705,-0.01464498,0.009772486,-0.07993291,-0.058200937,-0.045954008,0.00952747,0.090710916,0.07147397,-0.07132361,-0.061447192,-0.0138044385,0.084393375,0.069902405,-0.015200232,-0.091348924,-0.018632963,0.07574846,0.026707225,0.051634867,-0.0091795605,-0.069166176,-0.096393585,-0.0084715905,0.020516114,-0.084825225,0.06642803,0.022907078,-0.005586866,0.008924476,-0.029395292,0.0028309047,-0.09993916,0.051478803,-0.044535644,-0.04370753,-0.0051910696,-0.0015405538,0.023139345,0.012870237,-0.025236279,-0.005177274,0.043244246,0.016878713,0.09684825,-0.053902976,0.064506166,-0.04069321,0.004260398,-0.041520976,0.027083617,-0.13114214,-0.02972175,-0.008764954,-0.10049825,0.009161851,0.024574494,0.028614689,0.045353994,0.035406247,-0.023727693,0.10018771,0.07427225,-0.02261729,-0.013936667,-0.022312315,-0.016846182,0.01232726,0.061843142,-0.034143433,0.043908454,-0.025878446,0.01184996,0.09195128,0.038531415,0.02499111,0.03241763,-0.024359439,-0.09126687,-0.052822825,-0.05990532,0.0509512,-0.03701288,-0.012812654,-0.07813767,0.015876763,-0.067085035,-0.12128851,0.00072996,0.035209477,0.020055236,0.031645607,-0.00718738,-0.09785794,0.01834211,0.041865613,0.007302952,0.0189753,0.04899465,-0.014811052,-0.016594736,-0.01658525,2.7227803e-33,-0.007545352,-0.007944821,-0.053227086,0.10062923,0.00876196,-0.027829345,-0.04455743,-0.021912958,0.07921258,0.010144548,-0.0028608174,0.101495065,0.07171442,0.016474737,0.022208977,0.032186855,-0.012637312,0.0484432,-0.097056665,0.024598954,0.01624841,-0.09834604,0.1037733,-0.011201377,0.013847537,0.04023772,0.03644533,-0.04387776,-0.02348419,-0.012866142,0.033652022,-0.03124722,-0.012888278,-0.055145808,0.0753317,-0.07009924,0.045710657,0.0029252388,0.052796137,0.031161511,-0.027579414,-0.020155119,0.03173374,-0.047507934,-0.0010735276,0.06559696,0.0105654,0.0340877,-0.005709153,0.010997695,-0.054472804,-0.058146376,0.10342622,0.022322632,0.0086359065,0.06385764,-0.009822333,-0.017935133,-0.038070366,0.02812202,0.065307595,0.029842528,-0.034100387,0.016785918,-0.03477662,0.0037384536,-0.080899775,0.073126726,0.07057803,0.0019553518,-0.0027049535,0.00057660596,-0.006255742,0.026882222,0.07242634,0.014163653,0.032536596,0.03247158,-0.10835026,-0.0588765,0.026921988,-0.10702335,-0.009168898,-0.14063527,-0.10302269,-0.030716656,0.0829391,-0.020901265,-0.014413632,-0.033613984,-0.070730545,0.0103161065,-0.08353246,0.07462528,0.02406787,-4.5112222e-33,-0.059490558,0.10407009,-0.066941775,0.0032508473,0.09463773,0.06626944,0.05547477,0.027650869,0.038178723,-0.017346315,-0.09272213,-0.099359155,0.016425991,-0.0061320933,0.023061711,-0.02465273,-0.0042407657,-0.0075807525,-0.070248745,-0.029394414,-0.021533212,0.0674973,-0.020982213,-0.01940985,0.04672948,0.086181976,-0.057653353,-0.080106415,-0.09874612,-0.0016011661,-0.016953282,-0.013928976,-0.0304664,0.0065202382,-0.09818088,-0.032668334,0.040500883,-0.08875905,-0.023626544,0.0689197,0.026699273,0.0127168065,0.008683643,-0.047794413,0.04225014,0.035718314,-0.030455163,-0.0074759526,0.00714575,0.019945776,0.0008123313,0.064984374,0.0055249697,0.0427554,0.04237117,-0.031119736,0.023115678,-0.103335656,-0.076894194,-0.014627202,-0.030745098,-0.020295322,-0.010441309,0.03139342,0.045655083,-0.025603725,-0.010889415,-0.10686257,-0.06319994,0.1055224,0.019402403,-0.019674862,-0.036831513,-0.064288855,0.08562354,0.08196374,-0.08413412,-0.020697737,-0.072036736,0.0059741833,-0.007553293,-0.08827839,0.07262083,0.0074858135,-0.042521935,0.0400541,-0.0069544693,-0.024326222,-0.011231747,0.049924567,-0.07283379,-0.010883961,-0.0056094243,-0.029714508,0.0008159237,-5.5996427e-08,-0.04825734,-0.058262423,-0.026657207,0.0072646877,0.073420845,0.011683032,-0.08347765,0.075830586,0.003017672,0.024196502,0.0955151,-0.0622948,-0.025910899,-0.021409279,0.024360005,0.037872966,0.07809976,0.042894904,-0.0374146,-0.044177067,0.011297492,0.0060275374,-0.10271742,0.01184674,-0.014073443,-0.0044494653,-0.014001757,0.09557068,-0.050181925,-0.015707219,0.048750624,-0.006722329,0.007368047,-0.04332435,-0.044853836,0.016511107,0.025703503,0.028937263,0.02472748,0.15964854,-0.06588142,0.035929658,0.0078182835,0.02900711,0.115919106,5.648429e-05,-0.10889417,-0.009908004,0.032439906,-0.055839248,0.0041413354,-0.07563617,-0.012958501,0.0065667867,-0.0050753406,0.07156883,0.015295596,0.05824482,-0.01670575,-0.03406982,0.038565032,0.075629294,-0.062678896,-0.007901183,6,-5.16611,25.81374,8
17,"in todays class , we first discussed about exploratory data analysis. we explored pivot table tool in excel . in which we worked first with the class data of summaries which we submit. we learnt how to arrange data according to different parameters, how to arrange them in rows and columns .then we worked eda on chemical lab data in excel sheet. we first arranged data according to time , ie , years then months then dates. and then assessed them like by finding the mean , minimum value , maximum value and so on. we them came across a 0 minimum value of a particular year , on exploring more , there were 3 days with no sensor reading , hence 0 . we then checked mean , median , mode and so on using data analysis tool and from that value, we concluded that, in assymetric distribution, mean is not around in the middle of min and max values . also its histogram will be on the one side. we can also check kurtosos and skewness to prove it. 
then we check outliers and anomalies. 
we used correlations for different features to bring out relationships in a heat map. 
in histograms , we can see outliers and can remove them to perform eda on the rest of the data.

29,"we began by using pivot tables in excel to combine big data grouping and summing up values to speedily calculate the important metrics such as totals, averages and counts. we followed this with exploratory data analysis (eda), where we employed summary statistics like mean median, variance and standard deviation together with visualization tools like histograms box plot '' and scatter plots to derive insights about data distribution finally we briefly discussed issues such as class imbalance and presented feature engineering and data transformation methods that are important to improve data quality and ready data for deeper

67,"class started by the introduction to pivot table. we can find various parameters of a data like average of total characters, sum, min, max and std of the total characters. we analyzed the data of the submissions of summaries. we checked the histogram  for the average number of characters. we noticed that the majority of the portion lies in the lesser number of characters. we further created a box plot to find that there were some outliers in the data. 
we calculated the skewness and kurtosis and plotted a scatter plot to support the conclusion for outliers. 
we get shape of distribution by the histogram. other methods can help us know about the outliers. 
for the data, we explored the maximum submissions, the minimum submission, the number of times they have submitted. then, we went to ""who on which date submitted what length of submission?"". there were several missing values in the overall sheet. 
sir moved to the chemical plant data. we understood how data can be calculated for every 5 min or every hour. but it will just explode the data. to find the inner fluctuations, we need to dub up data. on using pivot table, we found that a lot of data is missing. we went to the min, max and average value of the data. we found an anomaly: min value for zero for a parameter. to check the place in which the error occurred we cut down the observations into small chunks until we found it. on plotting this data, these anomalies were clearly visible. we also created histogram and box plots. it is a good practice to create all the images and view them at once. we noticed how the plots with and without outliers look different from one another.  later, we proceeded to see the documentation of the data. in the anomaly and questions were highlighted. we do not want to exclude feature that may be useful. we went on to check how many of the variables are independent. we noticed that out of these hundreds of data rows. we only need 17 principle component or 17 independent process to describe the entire process. also, we can reorganize data and bring similar observation together. this makes the heatmap look better. 
we also checked for the data obtained from a transformer operations. the incomplete can be from sensor failure or device failure. we noticed how there can be points where hypothesis can be generated and we need to decide if to accept it or reject it. quality of input depends on the quality of our exploratory data analysis.

81,"sir taught exploratory data analysis. he accomplished this by using pivot tables and excel. to gain an understanding of the session summary data set, we examine various elements from the pivot table, such as the mean, median, min, max, stdev, histogram, box plot, summary statistics, and scatter plot.  by doing this, we were able to identify a few outliers whose character values in the

92,"we began with an analysis of pivot tables in excel, which can be helpful for summarizing large datasets by arranging and aggregating information. we learned how to create pivot tables, re-arrange fields, and calculate important metrics like sums, averages, counts, and percentages to gain meaningful insights.

after that we learned some methods of exploratory data analysis (eda). we also learned important statistical parameters such as mean, median, variance, and standard deviation to understand the distribution of data alon with some methods of visualization such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots that enable us to identify patterns, trends in distribution, and outliers.

later on, we discussed problems like class imbalance, where a particular category is very heavily overrepresented, and it causes biased outcomes. we touched upon feature engineering and data transformation techniques briefly, which improve the quality of the data prior to performing more intensive

104,"we kicked off by exploring session summary data with pivot tables, uncovering skewed distributions and potential outliers. we then tracked trends like summary length, submission frequency, and weekly patterns. moving on to a pressure and temperature dataset, we corrected autofilled zeros and used box plots to spot outliersâ€”keeping in mind that some outliers might hold valuable insights.

next, we dived into exploratory data analysis and got familiar with plotly in python. to wrap up, we went over assignment e3, highlighting common mistakes such as incorrect file naming, mislabeling graphs, and using scatter plots instead of bell curves for normal distributions.",-0.024272917,-0.017208459,0.014928484,0.04719352,-0.009993772,-0.0711386,-0.015259462,0.008635285,-0.0436981,0.007149313,0.0062324074,0.00769008,-0.00146962,0.050365563,0.010694874,-0.112584926,-0.005313129,-0.07440876,0.0004077654,-0.023062598,-0.0692245,0.021776183,-0.023121115,0.012199883,0.104216225,-0.049283575,-0.031068282,-0.022705443,-0.048894584,-0.034347266,-0.051312663,0.08987377,0.032551408,0.027314683,0.03767211,-0.08803136,0.040056773,0.05486092,0.039633743,0.020905357,-0.026157152,-0.0179745,0.06471754,-0.0066503007,-0.039359476,-0.018241584,-0.091851726,-0.06320675,-0.0033256544,0.03117478,-0.040931948,0.03841803,0.053204056,0.0656004,0.023762487,-0.013914331,-0.046836596,-0.08329185,0.084977455,-0.0049335896,-0.036981307,0.027724111,-0.0024660996,0.0062502343,0.037069753,0.0378234,0.039845295,0.071019486,0.06568089,0.068361826,-0.060027104,0.034924094,-0.08455987,0.0030145117,0.027238958,0.03263818,-0.057578444,-0.032702804,-0.039781045,-0.08690659,-0.005625726,-0.047286898,-0.02775907,0.054955486,0.011554801,-0.065616414,0.07569098,0.07067329,0.02083404,0.055373836,-0.05173398,0.096210495,0.002498075,0.019789482,-0.050858676,0.1317967,0.046441205,-0.03609353,0.015524252,0.06317957,0.05351049,-0.025849976,0.007990346,-0.0054197693,0.044520985,-0.07100286,0.060816962,-0.04375036,0.0018158648,-0.016921306,-0.027881699,-0.008367816,-0.022199119,-0.068297565,0.094289124,-0.056206003,-0.0217197,0.043974113,-0.1204033,0.03013644,0.060863845,0.050474983,-0.026571635,0.07345002,0.021993097,0.08982063,-0.033192005,6.695306e-33,0.058533918,0.0022266866,2.6748278e-06,0.0077554267,0.045337267,-0.0016007299,-0.08159607,-0.016614418,-0.012531962,0.038211744,-0.01947864,0.11827158,-0.0258589,0.028969629,-0.024548376,0.016169412,-0.012118933,0.07684042,-0.035171937,0.011322266,-0.025250807,-0.08385376,0.011485885,-0.014431327,0.04921682,0.09302785,-0.027456464,-0.00038029443,0.01863956,0.0065714833,0.05141855,0.013339826,0.0014934615,-0.047560528,0.0017020977,-0.056429483,0.017628938,-0.04891008,0.061555628,0.05681863,-0.06336846,0.020656222,-0.04249808,-0.05306783,-0.037789047,0.09683488,0.038372934,-0.020539036,0.060366265,-0.04866756,-0.07070964,-0.034066234,0.06505864,0.079416625,-0.051619846,0.04842416,0.06521967,-0.0729328,-0.023283266,0.0079485625,0.013956171,0.0356697,-0.026140574,-0.14326513,-0.027975287,0.041915677,-0.03784923,0.088271074,-0.02800005,0.033480044,-0.040242348,0.063650176,-0.04207063,-0.009108181,0.036771394,0.025135413,0.04318907,0.013971192,-0.049128685,-0.006759639,0.012540043,-0.07761261,0.051715035,-0.04956074,-0.07119891,-0.04663248,0.060166482,-0.0073371488,-0.046423815,-0.030482313,-0.029846886,-0.012448027,-0.04567713,0.014716825,-0.060615774,-5.8722812e-33,-0.07376776,0.11829205,-0.029433917,0.04229294,0.05968441,0.0669904,0.008483921,0.02746426,0.13103051,-0.0023674264,-0.07817941,-0.096781895,0.021468565,-0.057656083,0.0829927,-0.02664589,0.00074141606,-0.011135329,-0.05725718,-0.032622766,-0.022347968,0.031843632,-0.14314342,-0.016857963,0.018190976,0.06350262,-0.10756593,-0.028661706,-0.08950617,-0.044890266,-0.06495686,0.027968053,-0.034751054,-0.06381511,-0.017292773,0.034551155,0.021994647,-0.018180156,-0.00926504,-0.04634587,0.05372149,0.057900928,0.0006340546,0.017396694,-0.00490387,0.09350092,-0.04502041,0.07734843,0.016079469,0.07405999,-0.046924733,0.051922213,-0.002172713,0.02692939,-0.020676311,-0.025766404,-0.0020095718,-0.036376312,-0.110220134,0.0095475465,-0.08138857,-0.02536454,0.01264365,0.022207903,-0.033927783,-0.037344873,-0.0195025,-0.07622932,-0.020023653,0.007711524,0.08502509,-0.06544975,-0.017860869,-0.07088296,0.047223896,0.05542129,-0.06384923,-0.03911326,-0.040842805,0.073128454,0.0004150778,0.038856722,0.047903325,0.07161426,-0.00989682,0.10295376,0.005615516,0.053164996,0.059511803,0.030556424,-0.049151566,-0.012185672,-0.041541766,0.046611782,0.08516772,-4.7727116e-08,-0.051714677,0.0013196555,0.021385511,0.030590275,0.03162185,0.035998464,0.03781481,0.15940993,-0.028082466,0.039510038,0.07236735,-0.0711622,-0.051145058,-0.055761993,-0.011762835,0.065590896,-0.007950498,0.08299516,-0.057240743,-0.03608343,-0.023347616,0.02888426,-0.04876215,0.0065284064,-0.0253825,0.018082177,-0.015753778,0.11127885,-0.02755374,-0.022951968,-0.031273406,-0.07108613,0.048516553,-0.032581408,-0.019381719,0.05698977,-0.031485423,0.0370105,-0.034982897,0.06884269,-0.076215036,0.052550774,-0.05950144,0.017011436,-0.02184555,0.015588258,-0.1140281,0.028280722,0.059182733,-0.08395331,0.049738295,-0.057231948,0.021861384,0.03840274,0.030525222,0.07362091,-0.041157532,0.053931706,0.021365594,-0.0055060443,-0.014482211,0.011424653,-0.10475794,0.020319154,6,-3.3227558,23.541132,8
106,"i learned how to analyze submission data using pivot tables to gain insights into skewness, minimum and maximum values. an in-depth exploratory data analysis was conducted, including examining individual student summary lengths. with a new dataset, preliminary insights were explored, along with a discussion on edge computing. quartiles were reviewed and calculated after sorting data, while line plots (before and after outlier removal) and histograms helped visualize trends. binning was introduced as a method for converting continuous variables into discrete categories, and correlation

160,"in this lecture, we explored how to perform exploratory data analysis (eda) on multiple datasets to extract useful information.

we first worked with a dataset containing summaries submitted by students. using an excel pivot table, we calculated important statistics like the mean, maximum, minimum, and standard deviation of the number of characters in each summary. to gain more insight into the distribution, we plotted histograms and scatter plots, which helped us understand how the data was spread out. additionally, we analyzed the minimum number of characters in the summaries for each day and plotted it against the dates. we did the same for the maximum and average values and also tracked the number of students submitting summaries each day. moreover, we examined each student's submission patterns, such as the number of characters they submitted and whether they submitted summaries on specific days.

next, we analyzed a sensor dataset with observations for each date. using pivot tables, we counted the number of data points for each year, which helped us select which data to use for training. we also visualized the input and output columns using line graphs, which allowed us to observe how the output changed with different inputs. by applying principal component analysis (pca), we discovered that only 17 out of 240 columns were needed to capture most of the variance in the data, meaning these 17 columns would be the independent features to use for further analysis.

finally, we worked with transformer data to create a time-series dataset. we focused on understanding the patterns over time and identified anomalies in the data. for example, we noticed unexpected fluctuations during the night when no output was expected, indicating a problem with the system.",0.014030521,0.0142120365,0.03592216,-0.033876,0.010145595,0.019571057,-0.041054633,0.0019099752,0.019819716,0.026387963,0.040429804,0.030229907,0.0154396985,0.016336707,-0.03195492,-0.011753047,0.013913052,0.012302444,-0.05202996,-0.062603876,0.0067839995,-0.013389509,0.0004637083,0.05039268,0.047189772,0.1122314,0.021669144,-0.04222123,-0.04407176,-0.042604644,-0.00904452,-0.012267684,0.08419503,0.06333401,-0.0695338,-0.032902226,0.00048787927,0.109997794,0.0320944,0.0028957692,-0.10805181,-0.021050053,0.084213525,0.037310768,0.023461966,-0.05663273,-0.06294185,-0.09821111,0.014273771,0.09485005,-0.05763672,0.03446755,0.01825766,0.011069075,0.01695642,-0.0072944565,-0.020446934,-0.058694463,0.052703008,-0.019458009,-0.07650621,-0.031002343,-0.03155983,-0.0035047906,-0.018278575,-0.061166197,0.007541809,0.08162331,0.051898614,0.04788331,-0.04922618,0.06964856,-0.04998437,0.037025418,-0.033828218,0.07048028,-0.097139016,-0.013376958,0.019681102,-0.053934295,0.021913014,0.00993061,0.0069572115,0.033967663,0.062473137,-0.05209181,0.035021063,0.020200599,-0.06780527,-0.006992284,-0.033135697,0.0619658,0.061833292,0.046606805,-0.040115137,0.05209264,-0.008454902,-0.035625875,0.081546254,0.070466906,0.007000524,0.05366601,-0.03789259,-0.070887625,-0.058455206,-0.09617093,0.052848145,-0.04810705,-0.008236294,-0.045439728,0.038350232,0.01873531,-0.14699431,0.011023403,0.07741836,-0.030463018,-0.012888149,0.032198265,-0.077755205,0.09600712,0.02764633,0.034093715,0.036206946,0.014235756,0.03416072,-0.05198202,-0.016462745,3.6656983e-33,0.10880128,0.021089686,-0.053348918,0.05861414,0.03355238,-0.028054083,-0.03026623,-0.00036196166,0.014944104,0.024190301,0.024067163,0.09604752,0.029380681,0.06133689,0.07457089,0.013888948,-0.021396006,0.058902584,-0.02891275,0.033050127,0.011128927,-0.1217925,0.099617295,-0.030343112,0.022260094,0.048908055,-0.013843529,0.025630377,-0.0009957507,-0.007834543,0.031373546,-0.057850588,-0.027954275,-0.016060919,0.030470444,-0.05966985,0.044160556,-0.06297299,0.11431465,0.065394625,-0.009956824,-0.014695287,-0.0027861765,-0.04724881,-0.014974801,0.12309875,0.0022562232,-0.027716264,0.05514341,-0.007648372,-0.06802247,-0.07971685,0.035358,-0.047379564,-0.00780835,0.058967307,-0.02061992,-0.06811127,0.022112407,-0.011562962,-0.06241073,0.08530535,0.01109288,-0.016901322,-0.037655022,-0.001770461,-0.03932397,0.06988425,0.07528037,-0.051796343,-0.030271275,-0.023395415,-0.019914392,-0.023852918,0.06431442,0.022443794,0.011866204,0.0022299858,-0.09225833,0.018866153,0.041515715,-0.09102218,0.025454449,-0.11478298,-0.017936274,0.0316329,0.039145213,-0.03443532,-0.0029696198,-0.031816974,-0.029429743,0.01421424,-0.09697812,0.019864798,0.011266455,-3.975941e-33,-0.018092493,0.15665357,-0.06034465,0.046749316,0.11797737,0.043424122,-0.019119767,0.05295604,0.04175687,-0.005102152,-0.06905933,-0.090339154,0.016845629,-0.060771756,-0.012062741,0.006360702,0.0003312992,0.007275902,-0.055070136,-0.055307664,-0.052999914,0.0317207,-0.11129988,-0.053005394,0.077465594,0.03394663,-0.018131912,-0.02706245,-0.05839938,0.005645716,0.0074235057,-0.07524055,-0.0364233,-0.0021203938,-0.09988581,-0.00572425,0.0043860245,-0.08255811,-0.0038680504,0.1311873,0.059441157,-0.0067934035,0.034726404,-0.030444397,-0.04403468,0.028108882,-0.050788626,0.12132386,0.019878129,-0.0019160988,-0.034216236,0.05717389,-0.03405662,-0.049595393,0.07295052,-0.06141966,0.108714476,-0.024114855,-0.09185339,0.02891949,-0.06625211,-0.054528102,0.016655814,0.015173546,-0.022736682,-0.076245256,0.027769933,-0.09307273,-0.0979143,0.068209566,0.06894956,-0.00012441547,0.03134774,-0.051892444,0.057002496,0.07248203,-0.055121686,-0.00836175,-0.06880486,0.04024039,-0.031482108,-0.047557656,0.043858916,0.02184083,0.016325347,0.06675557,-0.027965099,0.014762692,0.037506144,0.038604215,-0.05302996,-0.002807541,-0.009287845,0.014211755,0.026295627,-5.4640633e-08,-0.010505187,-0.03997216,-0.027064407,0.012836514,0.026348334,0.0055837203,0.02381213,0.055653743,0.006897992,0.02000631,0.12796862,-0.07645343,-0.087340444,-0.0145869525,0.070201024,0.05501451,0.042890824,0.011135302,-0.016283382,-0.04410232,0.075234845,-0.04077831,-0.053199057,0.010277662,0.0029044028,0.020239685,0.013131523,0.11746257,-0.05553547,-0.009934111,-0.002977862,-0.02942635,0.02711997,-0.070858136,-0.0012097452,-0.053475946,0.042167705,0.0041255383,0.014373395,0.08146571,-0.056149334,0.03151551,0.0006873868,0.02898114,0.026030198,0.038265787,-0.034486182,-0.005890942,0.046488944,-0.021958422,-0.023961283,-0.12074741,0.019689914,-0.01219091,0.060688507,0.091753386,-0.030008445,0.016605306,0.024687842,-0.04368583,-0.02321185,0.028559597,-0.1232789,-0.011919521,6,-5.9325128,25.865225,8
206,"today's class covered a diverse range of analytical and problem-solving concepts. we began with exploratory data analysis (eda), learning how to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and summarize key insights using visualizations and statistical techniques. moving on, we explored pivot tables, a powerful tool for dynamically summarizing and analyzing large datasets, especially useful in business and financial contexts. next, we tackled an optimization problem in a chemical plant, focusing on maximizing efficiency and minimizing costs through mathematical modeling and problem-solving techniques. finally, we delved into a case study on transformer failure, analyzing the causes of failures and exploring predictive maintenance strategies to enhance reliability and prevent breakdowns. the session provided valuable insights into data-driven decision-making and practical applications across industries.",-0.059149038,0.07057274,0.05000044,0.003148914,-0.02034115,-0.0242246,-0.051041573,0.09228184,-0.04460572,0.027579796,-0.070202306,0.03452292,0.0961975,0.07725004,-0.07624213,0.06368248,-0.05907577,0.01729755,-0.06470256,-0.11610664,-0.03337949,0.0024187176,-0.070654646,0.013772524,0.06399579,0.06053142,0.03433811,-0.0089800805,-0.07301871,-0.02799074,-0.0043885596,0.00025443174,-0.045670837,0.03532117,-0.02296513,0.024171704,-0.09460351,0.056198906,0.00019884775,-0.016342517,0.058125015,-0.054822333,0.03581394,-0.012745222,-0.008962487,5.9619593e-05,-0.028252563,-0.09293302,0.03277344,0.016568596,-0.069742434,-0.0074864035,0.01783965,0.042527195,0.05368176,0.025903128,0.06325011,-0.08184025,0.016097546,-0.022368796,0.06747347,-0.018193766,0.02669788,-0.024500253,-0.034595776,0.026597532,0.060030725,0.0015103202,-0.07724976,0.047271635,-0.05699172,0.046189684,-0.12213912,0.009141029,0.033349216,0.05428791,0.08398039,-0.091704056,-0.043630395,-0.031797457,0.034643196,0.0473942,-0.06163255,0.10455777,0.07901159,-0.04249737,0.02527512,0.007352357,0.039163895,-0.0362119,-0.036301903,0.05061385,0.08020159,0.007830748,-0.015294684,0.07206111,-0.030556487,-0.07405236,0.013686114,0.020172607,-0.010384556,0.041098513,0.060233094,-0.06605307,-0.06836172,-0.12627761,0.028876785,0.054866485,-0.041598294,-0.06264199,0.024883902,-0.02378102,0.004461041,-0.055970065,0.007185427,-0.050395526,-0.03275446,-0.026329948,-0.04062282,0.040921714,0.06416225,0.028523937,0.0043142466,0.049969245,-0.0027200158,0.030892955,-0.052693415,1.155869e-33,-0.059541002,-0.045247763,0.090025984,0.0527325,0.03390437,-0.030594638,-0.00761366,0.025335675,0.019673727,0.032564007,0.019477658,0.11408599,-0.045830708,-0.016875997,0.04915491,-0.0068533537,-0.023701215,0.09175434,-0.09109719,-0.090275496,-0.016223714,-0.0761279,0.04234909,0.022964515,0.0243108,-0.0145262,0.0560644,-0.015619252,5.334812e-05,-0.029693564,0.007624676,0.011245176,-0.045120575,-0.028767914,0.0013960311,-0.027565688,0.00262247,-0.045836903,0.0035847703,0.06227689,-0.11483613,0.016336873,-0.029856613,0.060677465,0.0056174234,0.07001239,0.044121142,-0.03484752,0.0368248,-0.043283366,-0.047807276,-0.047489617,0.064291194,0.08398956,0.05810051,0.06241358,-0.029507935,-0.09580933,0.031785093,-0.01993179,-0.111647636,0.05894229,-0.0024362442,-0.039764374,-0.034928124,0.053021036,-0.008250131,0.037642796,0.039654933,0.034984138,0.0011575735,-0.076038584,0.02409731,-0.037135117,0.06742017,0.0008532874,0.071456626,0.06436188,-0.008984433,-0.039153945,0.018569993,-0.06521877,0.05664159,-0.017638497,-0.009076878,0.012636342,0.070310876,0.011573026,-0.08571619,-0.0328911,-0.02815245,0.062663175,-0.007406852,0.002150579,0.041644,-2.018929e-33,-0.086459264,0.058519196,-0.0030969079,-0.009399846,0.0655276,-0.034765985,-0.13463537,-0.061290365,0.08293189,0.010422005,-0.06845549,-0.083881564,-0.013325968,-0.05085127,-0.043386444,0.017470922,-0.0073203486,-0.08012784,-0.032241553,0.0463921,-0.022989128,0.09260704,-0.12794952,-0.02175442,-0.09189406,0.06901836,-0.036682874,-0.038816467,-0.0041864603,-0.028434835,-0.04640182,-0.0826981,-0.0009197004,0.06930759,-0.09256359,0.054891605,-0.024772564,-0.06461057,0.04507356,0.03707138,0.035253312,-0.03199311,-0.03307279,0.02816845,-0.018525887,-0.04947838,0.04578497,-0.05273982,0.054914124,0.06944319,0.006665092,0.03372604,-0.034506444,-0.026950093,-0.0064341193,-0.020996325,0.07500581,-0.001368808,-0.0031683631,0.059019808,-0.018895715,0.013239153,0.102166176,0.009948429,-0.08388674,-0.022188509,0.0656612,-0.07047984,0.0071654967,0.01622748,0.0076416642,0.029469797,0.020806896,-0.08301281,0.04362425,0.057845537,-0.09034726,0.007854104,-0.05420576,0.013663742,0.021408578,-0.024276303,0.019135462,-0.008705425,-0.008189866,-0.024982871,0.041036446,0.06146605,0.11522524,0.022583233,-0.11913754,-0.017532554,-0.06786489,0.027894273,-0.00874706,-4.4905782e-08,-0.025264738,0.08215877,0.023394484,-0.026167024,0.06767269,-0.08353076,0.07541697,0.15896018,-0.062594265,0.0254188,0.07935757,-0.0052863546,-0.00075140054,0.043868214,-0.000889364,0.06996499,0.030686298,0.08825383,-0.026916025,0.049233433,-0.037424624,0.023197008,-0.07984316,0.020473996,-0.022784295,-0.014912329,-0.008653514,0.06630743,0.008289026,0.0288975,-0.01113133,-0.0036160839,0.06446194,0.00902616,-0.013705583,0.040418655,0.07027607,-0.070219874,-0.077465996,-0.060903165,-0.036152028,0.10155296,-0.030301834,0.073620066,-0.008455169,0.06645521,-0.052512735,0.007863802,0.031315863,0.011603399,0.0058934093,-0.05871545,-0.0010256651,0.03836595,0.05597295,0.035183236,0.00049263245,0.011120756,0.023015471,-0.020734275,-0.009566145,-0.006842961,-0.033153493,0.030407788,6,-8.412655,30.409117,8
225,"in today's lecture, sir explained how to do exploratory data analysis (eda). he used excel and pivot tables to do so. we look at different things like mean, median, min, max, stdev, histogram, box plot, summary statistics, 
 scatter plot from the pivot table in order to get an idea about session summary data set. using this we were able to get some outliers whose summary's character values were significantly higher than others. then we also did the same eda for different dataset related to chemical plant where there was a data filled in 241 columns on daily basis for around 6 years. there were also some missing

229,"in today's class we mainly discussed what is exploratory data analysis and how we perform it. for this we ran through an example of data and with the help of pivot table, we tried to get as many insights from the data as we can by observing the box plots, scatter plots, histograms etc. of the data and making conclusions from these plots. by observing the number. of characters submitted by each student in the session summaries for our course, we saw that the maximum value is far away from the mean than the minimum. from this we tried to see whether the distribution is skewed or there are some outliers in the data by observing the box plots and we saw that the data did have some outliers. from this we discussed whether these outliers meaning no. the characters submitted are really constant for a particular student or does this show the jerkiness of a student where on some days he may have submitted more in the lecture summary. this data can be called as time series data. then we also saw the data for a chemical process and saw that for some years the minimum value of some variable was zero and as we dug deep into this problem we saw that the reason behind it being zero was some absent data. like this we also tried to gain some other insights also. in the end, feedback for exercise 2 was provided by the

240,"eda was the primary topic of discussion. two datasets from different contexts were chosen and eda was done on them. they are as follows
1. our summary submissions: we used pivot tables to explore various aspects of the data like average character count for every class submission, max, min characters of the submission. then box plot was used to visualize the outliers present in the dataset. scatter plot and histogram to visualize the distribution of characters count.
2. data from a chemical factory setting: similar eda practice was presented.
finally the discussion ended with the analysis of our submissions of assignment 2.",-0.008432584,-0.057201613,0.006192366,-0.014942488,-0.06874496,0.039632026,0.0064730407,0.059302483,0.0052720895,0.033755038,0.03528849,0.022588084,0.052117683,-0.004295687,-0.07568896,-0.03416618,0.09104082,-0.05526729,-0.08875072,-0.06536481,0.007313905,0.008946108,0.026483575,0.011975118,0.01923969,0.03441184,0.007508818,0.005543248,-0.03212415,-0.10167517,-0.043785173,0.05638853,0.096459806,0.03114367,-0.02445603,0.0008953519,0.032678206,0.06248324,0.042776998,-0.020568712,-0.05767559,0.00022555278,0.076574065,0.055729672,0.06956609,-0.04849414,-0.12966175,-0.06546292,-0.030280143,0.0249661,0.0013161801,0.023282936,0.002004528,0.061857026,0.0066976687,-0.049214244,0.04357849,-0.07909137,0.01788434,0.014869338,-0.046461277,0.0025939187,-0.0038660313,0.036653295,0.028604247,-0.014869998,0.04065224,0.032908168,-0.023870721,-0.015432554,-0.0533369,0.07193996,-0.06191677,0.081963114,-0.006789708,-0.016873827,-0.05502403,-0.033469692,0.050956417,-0.07263591,0.029306145,0.039220106,-0.007732363,0.047937807,0.054463103,-0.021028496,-0.015808906,0.015964705,0.037776608,0.011358678,0.0117499055,0.07091097,0.08745365,0.016285503,-0.014735778,0.0458034,0.015940253,-0.007711782,0.02787145,0.03926312,0.00029886863,-0.025506804,-0.06400557,-0.07727874,-0.06558472,-0.058527205,0.059985485,-0.040927034,-0.015190426,-0.038607307,-0.032874066,-0.011754924,-0.09689189,0.011303565,0.057638604,-0.042362206,0.02194824,-0.0127119245,-0.083855964,-0.013959472,-0.03504266,-0.013123328,0.024338046,0.014232415,0.025666509,0.009960559,-0.06560453,5.767916e-33,0.09975639,-0.012394449,-0.06829704,0.054358892,0.06408558,-0.02773874,-0.061046764,0.0074652093,0.025737032,-0.016502507,-0.030953813,0.10335322,0.019972557,0.11781232,0.025399847,0.024160145,0.018057149,0.061026745,-0.07700927,-0.00046814844,-0.039165825,-0.090686515,0.06689451,-0.013506189,-0.0042347903,0.09190938,-0.05199394,-0.049524847,0.024836581,0.009223409,0.0166223,-0.05328587,0.029484501,-0.02592201,0.025953284,-0.034993708,0.008103959,-0.010484955,0.113329835,0.08460476,0.026544338,0.028475067,0.01826669,-0.024932193,-0.03072316,0.09800751,0.011941235,-0.04738764,0.02724136,-0.021622345,0.00034867754,-0.04035804,0.09078026,0.030729556,0.012413568,0.02881899,0.00085832446,-0.10667791,0.024333976,0.05871192,-0.034868192,0.1455845,0.014044681,-0.044013686,-0.04899391,-0.009421323,-0.09902175,-0.017227931,0.015310472,0.02414474,0.004921528,-0.007476286,-0.10825675,0.029747594,-0.03665148,0.030126737,-0.0003315459,0.08712531,-0.05666368,0.0031008213,0.015883744,-0.066824876,-0.0322558,-0.12757638,-0.06827614,-0.038009707,0.033618372,-0.022821559,0.014618459,-0.01586561,0.041557644,-0.027141133,-0.07173203,0.014363828,0.065734796,-5.9220693e-33,-0.09580575,0.11806099,-0.03143376,0.055258583,0.093973145,0.018066633,-0.07678799,-0.010350647,0.16154334,0.07517539,-0.061008904,-0.03364651,0.006718752,-0.07560407,0.042681713,-0.05265119,-0.007694259,-0.00580608,-0.029653585,-0.06814472,0.028912658,0.015357567,-0.08556957,-0.04045924,0.045232758,0.043672808,-0.06947562,-0.055389497,-0.037957005,-0.038275,0.04179152,-0.040579416,-0.048345122,0.0194748,-0.09977638,-0.0110037895,0.045729317,-0.06868655,0.018409016,0.05278732,0.058268495,-0.024481976,0.01375222,0.10807387,-0.05578401,0.006597556,-0.0383376,0.01819476,0.056395464,0.034236703,-0.0239478,0.05378699,0.032681577,0.02593747,0.022391658,-0.007963707,0.07303295,-0.04330013,-0.0272715,0.07402892,-0.00068648875,0.00989657,-0.025425203,0.007932805,-0.046187717,-0.040900063,-0.0013004335,-0.02644779,-0.10109203,0.030027466,0.09350366,-0.04415812,-0.048888627,-0.03664364,-0.014171125,0.009028586,-0.08870779,0.022361042,-0.024655795,0.029168013,-0.05408004,-0.0641027,0.044411264,0.11398684,-0.04031436,0.061386816,0.032061953,-0.028564923,-0.019818248,0.035832964,-0.027796526,-0.049679562,-0.018669335,0.03404878,0.021184571,-5.6245028e-08,-0.060122013,-0.087854914,0.017807323,-0.04756987,0.025812684,0.018273504,-0.020764193,0.120065786,-0.020035604,0.04383241,0.07245994,-0.02627518,-0.05455256,0.012238917,0.03681999,0.024183,0.045256462,0.1113529,-0.053391807,-0.018754063,0.11979349,0.03061339,0.042264137,-0.065284334,-0.0640702,0.0077776182,0.00586509,0.11392773,-0.08748038,-0.0126212,0.003734568,-0.0025263245,-0.022030018,-0.064753205,0.03468593,0.0020570152,-0.009545038,-0.036987964,-0.06747119,0.04593991,-0.06384316,-0.019963482,0.029571325,0.04864461,0.07143602,0.04306663,-0.025934042,-0.027950918,0.049346622,-0.08864324,-0.04363028,-0.13094702,0.008004829,-0.002505607,-0.031967442,0.077925116,-0.014689481,0.005547713,0.085893475,-0.067186095,0.035554107,0.031325266,-0.080711655,0.014617686,6,-2.8117034,28.476654,8

266,"todayâ€™s session mainly based on exploratory data analysis. it involves exploring the data to identify patterns, trends, outliers and other features that may be unexpected. it often utilises summary statistics such as mean, median, mode and skewness to describe the central tendency and distribution of the data. we saw 3 examples of eda which is performed on different domains or industries data. the first one is a case of chemical plant in which we have 241 columns. the second one is case of transformer device which is also a case of imbalanced dataset. the third one is summary dataset. through summary datasets we learnt about the â€œpivot tableâ€ in excel which helps in summarising and analysing data in easy and simple manner without writing any code. it also helps in summarising

286,"class started with pivot table. dependinv on the level of details want, we are going more levels deeper. we saw conversion of histogram to box plot in excel to have an idea about outliers. most common submission lie in a band. we used line diagram for dates and total characters/avg characters. mainly we learnt about exploratory data analysis, and infer from there trends and analysis we can derive. we can check for anamolies.
we did another case study on the plant with 241 columns. manipulating to get desired analysis. then finally we had discussion on e2 assignment",0.0570711,0.010715168,-0.019994311,-0.0143576525,-0.031518113,0.03082476,-0.06449475,0.05506465,-0.054819174,0.04842365,0.037087414,-0.02553566,0.059298206,-0.031635836,-0.084374145,-0.009629092,0.014632321,-0.0189074,-0.03482916,-0.06484963,-0.022769608,-0.0042338413,-0.02874336,-0.05083554,0.03557738,0.03788203,-0.038230076,0.031014074,-0.041692372,-0.15636139,-0.06388592,0.07383392,0.070090264,0.047102697,-0.065177776,-0.037622463,0.030495716,0.026558233,0.050722614,0.029362535,-0.028951425,0.006078144,0.092996016,0.021934325,0.0016177692,-0.021868957,-0.118902646,-0.08332068,-0.026378617,-0.039943084,-0.049948085,0.02855247,0.019453477,-0.031281967,-0.008233643,-0.06507348,-0.0038786016,-0.07852456,0.082974896,-0.03770402,-0.019908156,0.07272188,0.012245671,0.0050462363,0.02474172,-0.03708764,-0.026050568,0.06876453,0.04358295,0.039876796,-0.022903787,0.03697098,-0.07597714,0.023596011,-0.026150798,0.039921902,-0.08180965,0.0076170787,0.027077112,-0.06726684,-0.029204158,0.030409344,-0.014806843,0.03980092,0.009197273,-0.0439655,0.013299826,0.06830624,-0.030837486,0.043746594,0.032839455,0.04345679,0.081195556,0.04786299,-0.0512016,0.083260685,0.047074568,-0.06793723,0.09556695,0.05164061,-0.024119785,0.0139442,-0.06638243,-0.043020282,-0.032378983,-0.079830006,0.08225641,-0.04193819,0.016314412,-0.07659002,-0.013161455,-0.0746533,-0.12547028,-0.06704327,0.041946184,0.0041552912,0.040585082,-0.010092057,-0.06523753,-0.034403548,0.03713997,0.015048719,-0.011919199,0.05741628,-0.025265586,-0.021668024,-0.11655072,5.6140284e-33,0.0049731988,-0.012492544,-0.048683155,0.070912,0.04678202,-0.010374456,-0.075612634,-0.013884708,0.053156912,-0.009919682,-0.031088509,0.0939426,-0.0067830835,0.04403361,0.032482155,0.011919541,-0.019622235,0.01689306,-0.053947162,-0.009327128,-0.015115175,-0.08927779,0.043106038,0.0209891,0.072249845,0.08428114,0.02172613,-0.056327455,0.037351187,0.011425366,0.10529793,-0.028134488,-0.040770765,-0.017051555,0.014027912,-0.08271349,0.0146371955,0.021331802,0.083303,0.04956638,0.04083481,0.002339957,0.0051612933,-0.0056533436,0.005894562,0.09962691,0.06429322,0.03453093,0.07141815,-0.03084527,-0.052887,-0.030525057,0.08430405,0.009838814,0.015521751,0.028165739,0.028770123,-0.0072850143,0.020637974,0.090407364,0.026841408,0.058654547,0.0388334,-0.030783942,-0.014213894,-0.032647155,-0.07913416,-0.03277384,0.0053546787,0.05144803,0.011437371,-0.024477178,-0.04608227,0.0022319416,0.014779553,0.041033775,-0.004302266,0.02870123,-0.05384617,-0.047986757,-0.016114822,-0.04593677,-0.0017570725,-0.1278175,-0.10008935,-0.040375985,0.03755456,0.0066363662,-0.050738484,0.0860227,0.047415406,0.013314443,-0.063062385,0.021757877,0.069852665,-5.5631405e-33,-0.06972372,0.17751487,-0.020982949,0.010786981,0.09561139,0.035668537,-0.053381015,0.00043934942,0.13226506,0.09576121,-0.090418324,-0.021972986,0.054093763,-0.010846444,0.022188421,-0.022674533,0.0040432266,-0.01743703,-0.066217944,-0.020517457,-0.0768005,0.112392,-0.07653918,-0.0244095,0.025502123,0.108616285,-0.08297898,-0.04406272,-0.095794104,-0.031528894,-0.079769254,-0.04766139,-0.024111053,0.022184175,-0.11089857,0.02736135,0.03173727,-0.08283831,0.019809585,0.028656034,0.015870932,0.058212314,-0.026336115,-0.023026614,0.035146054,0.06567778,0.003077436,0.106911555,0.06839902,0.046080276,-0.027227324,0.13152902,0.015673956,0.03195919,0.027813962,0.018115489,0.050659534,-0.034723926,-0.048571806,0.073244624,-0.033258464,-0.046726886,0.018786525,0.006371553,-0.027505057,-0.024772568,0.017126745,-0.047405448,-0.029144207,0.033609714,0.052470423,-0.048543707,-0.012328657,-0.061385933,0.028134424,0.037538424,-0.05619838,-0.00435686,-0.042775657,-0.021903204,-0.040817488,-0.038482048,0.07608094,0.04273145,-0.01632292,0.007514265,0.0055845645,-0.07013004,0.04282531,0.09767004,-0.053709667,-0.01565865,-0.053288266,0.0066748676,0.06785666,-5.7402435e-08,-0.04153514,-0.0643264,0.011970957,0.020361254,0.084975146,-0.028684529,-0.077603675,0.11098866,0.013454253,0.09369504,0.04259095,-0.04105416,-0.052023843,-0.0068024686,0.06423181,0.023582844,0.035329696,0.0971017,-0.061498526,0.014263941,0.0037664948,-0.009380912,-0.016673543,0.012937599,-0.033833805,-0.031948272,-0.04044495,0.05805738,0.033084426,-0.021279853,0.03194078,0.00463304,0.029537221,-0.064963974,-0.016774273,0.015328635,-0.033984035,0.005698695,-0.034878094,0.05952901,-0.012539675,-0.010119303,-0.06484076,0.026190596,0.010992653,0.04754628,-0.06838354,-0.042621326,0.051257737,-0.07936105,-0.029291162,-0.076936506,0.016018135,-0.02666047,-0.021511713,0.029305648,0.007765211,0.029120544,0.07776131,-0.034386933,-0.027576141,0.065978214,-0.042712204,-0.015332727,6,-3.9322398,26.601664,8
315,"in today's session we we started with pivot tables and how to use them to draw inferences from the data using min, max, std dev etc. it's a necesssary part of the exploratory data analysis. then we saw how to see how many outliers we have and how they vary within the data by using line plots, histograms, scatter plots and box plots. the decision boundary which is usually between q1-1.5iqr and q3+1.5iqr can be changed according to the data and its just a common practice to use 1.5 and we could have higher or lower number than that according to the data we have. if in our data we have large difference between mean and median, the mean is severely affected by the outliers and hence it indicates that the outliers exist in the data. outliers are not always insignificant and they may be telling crucial exceptions that may be occuring in our system and its useful that way in telling us about the potential failures in sensors and other things. later we discussed two industry projects where eda was heavily utilised in getting insights from the data and raising necessary questions which would later be utilised to solve the data on a large scale.

318,"in this lecture, we continued our discussion on eda. we learnt how to create pivot tables in excel, which summarize the entire data into a table, whose entries can be chosen by us. this will help us create a summary of the data and understand the various trends and patterns in the data. using the pivot table entries, one can then create plots to analyze the distribution/ pattern in the data. this can be used to predict any desired value in future. the example which we discussed in class was that of the average number of characters in the summary on any particular day. this can be useful to predict the approximate number of characters in the summary of any day in the future.
we can use various plots including- box plots, scatter plots, histograms, as well as descriptive statistics function in excel to determine the outliers in the data set. any of these can be used to reach out to a conclusion regarding the outliers. also, it is not always correct to completely disregard the outliers, as they may also reveal certain important problems, patterns in the data, which cannot be ignored.
eda includes all these tasks of cleaning, comprehending, analyzing the data and extracting valuable insights from it, which can be further used to build a model. 
apart from this, we also looked at two case studies. one was regarding the measurements of numerous different parameters related to a process in chemical plant, with the measurements collected on daily basis. we created a pivot table which included the various parameters in the columns and the dates in the rows. then we added the values of- count of the total measurements made in that year, the average, max, min of these measurements for each of the parameter. we observed in some cases, the min value of the parameter dropped to 0, which cannot be practically possible, as we cannot have 0 pressure or temperature. the problem occurred due to the missing values of these parameters on some days.
the next case study was about the creation of energy using solar radiation. the oil and water temperatures were recorded at different time intervals, and the data was available. various line plots were created to analyze the variation in these temperatures at different times of the day and further on different days.
correlation maps were also made to understand the correlation between the various independent variables. there were certain patterns in the temperatures, from birdâ€™s eye point of view. however, more distinct patterns were observed within these large variations, when looked through a zoomed in perspective, suggesting hour-to-hour as well as daily variations in the temperatures. all these plots could be analyzed, to help us understand how we can separate the noise from the signals, identify the outliers, and use them to predict the values of the output variable in the future.

374,"today's lesson began with an introduction to excel pivot tables and their applications in summarizing and analyzing huge datasets. in order to understand the data, we practiced making pivot tables, dragging and dropping fields, and computing important metrics (totals, averages, counts, and percentages). after that, we did exploratory data analysis (eda), to observe data distribution using summary statistics such as mean, median, variance, and standard deviation. to find trends, patterns, and outliers, we also observed graphs, scatter plots, box plots, and histograms. then, we saw class imbalance, where results are highly influenced by a single category. then we saw. feature engineering and data transformation done before further analysis to clean the

382,"we started by analysing the data of session summary, and created a pivot table of different formats and plotted the values to get a better understanding. data should technically be a normal distribution, but our mean was closer to the lower value as compared to higher, so our graph was skewed- which means there are outliers. to go one step further we can try to understand if the outliers are consistent or if they keep changing every session. we could also see how session summaries changes through the days. we went through a few more things, like length variation of summaries, frequency of submission per person, min and max trends over the weeks, all this can be done by simple tool pivot table. then we went through a pressure and temperature dataset, and did similar analysis. wherever temperature is autofilled as 0, we have to take care of that and ensure that it's corrected. outliers can be identified by box plot, we can split the data into 4 quartiles. take care that it's not always right to reject outliers, because they may actually mean something, not just be there by accident... the we learnt about exploratory data analysis, and then another library in python called plotly. in the last 20-30 minutes we went over assignment e3, common mistakes everyone made like file naming, plotting the wrong kind of graph (to show normal distribution a bell

389,"in the beginning of the lecture we started with learning pivot tables in excel, seeing how they make summarizing big sets of data easy through the organization and grouping of values. we got to experiment with creating pivot tables, reorganizing fields to fit our perspective, and doing important calculations like totals, averages, counts, and percentages to improve data analysis. moving on in the lecture, we learned some exploratory data analysis techniques. we practiced summary statistics such as mean, median, variance, and standard deviation which were used to observe the distribution of the data and we also used visualization tools like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to learn about the patterns, outliers, and trends in the data. later on, we briefly touched on some universal problems, such as class imbalance, where there is a prevailing category that throws off the analysis. we also introduced feature engineering and data transformation briefly which are the central steps in pre-processing data prior to delving into analysis in more

391,"sir initially explained about exploratory analysis. then ta explained the steps of eda with examples of pima india etc. then we discussed the box plot,matrix plot etc helps analyze how class imbalances affect our multivariate approach involving options like knn, fatal regression model etc. then we learnt to handle outliers which arise due to data corruption, faulty measurements etc. there are techniques through which one can determine which value is outliers. handling outliers also involves univariate and multivariate approaches.",-0.042706758,0.024437366,-0.012802717,-0.03925819,-0.008409592,-0.03772853,-0.048877895,0.060983937,-0.012894432,0.07672346,-0.018283788,0.04636248,-0.033260982,0.010544538,-0.044326495,-0.053345177,0.012137163,-0.02909685,-0.05605019,-0.065509945,-0.0028323843,-0.013803431,-0.03733101,-0.0016468869,-0.04502821,0.03195729,0.06511856,-0.030723644,-0.053551417,-0.07969364,0.025618318,0.08991219,0.032818817,-0.028167631,-0.10149181,0.068513304,0.09070034,0.07517342,0.026426574,-0.0175778,-0.03661266,0.012945489,0.052870724,0.008257004,0.07654825,-0.11461555,-0.10610014,-0.11059683,-0.021575665,-0.021635463,-0.032826673,-0.012452589,0.011874928,-0.01836443,0.025751213,-0.05751826,0.031879336,-0.032718282,-0.014469831,0.00818634,-0.015779112,0.010680765,-0.043221276,0.03158667,0.121272504,-0.095171005,0.033134818,0.038167167,0.012349322,0.03865825,-0.0022898468,-0.018790439,-0.08746346,0.005158559,0.04426932,-0.0067939307,-0.040858164,-0.0063260566,0.0048290743,-0.03194771,0.040568653,0.10898584,-0.029879225,0.07470524,-0.028266983,-0.0051097614,-0.04988811,-0.035641838,0.04517997,0.019699851,0.09799319,0.030751418,0.017698478,0.040361427,0.060012016,-0.011753809,-0.05787278,-0.044241972,0.02867378,0.019135432,0.064274475,-0.0058419453,-0.09235621,-0.0036743656,-0.0747807,-0.11107271,0.086024284,-0.019799048,0.02914622,0.004752923,-0.0729708,0.000874851,-0.06551669,0.007841824,0.02434103,-0.005594617,0.060644038,0.016635649,-0.050477836,-0.033969596,-0.034947973,-0.012405751,-0.01066852,0.06351793,0.011287007,0.038503528,-0.12812218,2.9147262e-33,0.039364807,0.025186889,-0.04671608,0.05726283,0.000710857,-0.0157296,-0.07799339,-0.057841767,0.041386455,0.03982436,0.03963143,0.17383793,0.009750279,0.030819627,0.024145987,-0.0049844715,-0.046333913,0.07558179,-0.0030719305,0.009899317,-0.0006585589,-0.07646305,0.038885754,-0.0005296127,0.037798762,0.117944434,0.0656727,0.008221933,0.052759387,0.008637141,0.041701507,-0.035682492,-0.09444905,0.0011962468,0.019198136,-0.038877934,-0.032063544,-0.04157232,0.027384114,0.04225505,-0.029438807,-0.04539828,0.04111597,-0.035583727,0.055303235,0.060745645,-0.01043183,-0.025254449,0.029819708,-0.007595871,-0.04651046,-0.032746118,0.030424703,-0.025408419,-0.02097762,0.014087741,-0.005821557,-0.09197621,0.030758863,0.031421855,-0.013139573,0.014684955,-0.04691639,-0.077601254,-0.08361068,-0.030806594,-0.033057634,-0.047901157,-0.016975049,0.04801395,-0.063181564,0.034448475,-0.070911534,0.05765727,-0.039483752,-0.019552529,-0.052186623,0.10068879,-0.010735579,0.039185427,-0.068136446,-0.015688635,0.027518965,-0.07167808,-0.042434573,-0.038745914,0.06657834,0.02597542,0.033948705,0.012049346,-0.028367689,0.0064375987,-0.05497826,0.055068064,0.0761736,-5.6964045e-33,-0.06347416,0.07929349,-0.05200032,0.01489706,0.075489536,-0.015999116,-0.08369774,-0.0020914862,0.13710713,0.015591606,-0.07524454,-0.015263011,-0.008002021,0.040754266,0.06557195,-0.037516672,-0.012390303,-0.07533281,-0.06344868,-0.034025792,0.036497306,0.0051388387,-0.043837387,-0.059136555,-0.028623542,-0.0028736012,-0.041943215,-0.014950826,-0.10149069,-0.036837287,-0.0012549751,-0.04461475,-0.064271234,0.087245256,-0.060513824,0.06398706,0.044309624,-0.073213555,-0.02017509,0.059910025,-0.0076829996,0.025458494,0.028054362,-0.00582656,-0.012909258,0.00843259,-0.009723832,0.119754404,-0.012585157,0.019351186,0.036443494,0.08417582,0.07003978,-0.013348499,0.02821605,-0.027580418,0.11923519,-0.017824199,-0.016924698,0.08702996,0.00758557,0.0062600393,-0.02940043,0.0147732,-0.07821123,0.008443196,0.047440346,-0.049435347,-0.03017957,-0.0028242627,0.05679414,-0.05643763,-0.0482355,-0.05182835,0.023403736,0.0056526293,-0.13383627,-0.025574166,-0.017122407,-0.03169869,-0.0048490306,-0.06541784,0.074400805,0.058385566,-0.029332098,0.07635541,0.053779166,-0.037514146,0.0028451227,-0.034641646,-0.037513986,-0.062767476,-0.031243492,0.059894796,0.012653653,-3.848838e-08,-0.07702945,-0.073951885,0.048085567,-0.031220261,0.009857122,-0.042177808,-0.031303294,0.17812619,0.039752893,0.096011154,0.018163683,-0.035874125,-0.06766167,0.01661141,0.1000662,0.023421604,0.051683616,0.13797252,-0.045471016,0.011266036,0.08864723,-0.019161645,0.03354361,-0.02857711,-0.013277812,-0.0058459793,0.025401805,0.107961185,0.0050480375,0.048093595,-0.021500753,0.043896247,0.0065864017,-0.04547547,-0.02734879,0.03235959,0.09145608,-0.021915663,0.04817787,0.03806957,-0.091736555,-0.010978561,-0.0007617651,0.033040624,0.033580482,0.043922454,-0.059533328,0.024055824,0.009599075,-0.048560634,-0.08424979,-0.033787135,0.04676141,0.040220033,-0.001252922,-0.022751274,-0.022103343,-0.041555606,0.0018878409,0.036589522,0.039738126,0.055558868,-0.070279285,-0.016579455,6,-0.93521917,28.660004,8
393,"learned to use a tool in excel that organizes big data into groups and sums up values.
practiced making this tool, moving items around, and calculating sums, averages, counts, and percentages.
studied methods to understand data better by looking at key numbers like middle value, spread, and difference from the average.
used charts like bar graphs, box charts, and dot plots to spot trends, shapes, and unusual points in data.
discussed problems when one type of data appears much more than others, which can affect results.
briefly looked at ways to improve data by modifying and preparing it for deeper study.",0.0877577,0.028219447,0.0022570982,-0.029731544,-0.06435121,-0.0405459,-0.091180414,0.07853078,0.02106786,0.06764637,-0.00011565736,0.03487863,0.015707826,-0.030979602,0.013951305,0.049074166,0.019580534,-0.025013827,-0.035481587,-0.10536502,-0.053026266,-0.055595323,0.010705345,0.0015234972,0.08631996,0.055298064,-0.052848317,-0.006757453,0.023964293,-0.03268548,-0.08001697,0.052278694,0.062661976,0.06497944,-0.1197519,-0.027619082,-0.0039084717,0.12979724,0.05001923,0.016130587,-0.014542691,0.012588749,0.059012927,-0.024461616,0.007344186,0.032166302,-0.06291487,-0.008435947,0.01977888,0.076133415,-0.11246778,0.0068146004,-0.024331389,0.03323694,0.0648691,-0.014088899,-0.036396056,-0.046970457,0.10586549,-0.030908452,0.043291204,0.029610489,0.046934154,0.043451034,0.024623191,-0.0014213762,-0.0002636157,0.08679872,-0.02026093,-0.0067333938,0.06546767,0.052693445,-0.028004523,0.020206518,0.039661467,-0.015292048,-0.1003768,-0.006328725,0.004310501,-0.029679792,-0.007968324,0.017279034,-0.034446493,0.0855859,0.016439043,-0.031879585,0.078862935,0.022320716,-0.067166336,0.021707281,0.0014306814,0.045369092,0.0016696744,0.0003245664,-0.002514312,0.048828937,-0.016070787,-0.038381983,0.05006371,0.03438367,0.059316408,0.0002931966,0.023012962,-0.08668177,-0.037947834,-0.10603777,0.098049134,0.03500643,-0.008602316,-0.045075636,-0.002487557,0.009823838,-0.12816879,-0.0047902777,0.0028408312,-0.059357446,-0.015937872,-0.004868657,-0.020401694,0.0011044248,0.056021612,0.028755136,0.045242343,-0.002326055,0.008387554,0.04992684,-0.05771378,2.4529577e-33,-0.05626397,-0.10857955,-0.01569613,0.056584217,0.023486681,-0.031783964,-0.037466314,0.012113277,0.010170567,0.06330213,0.024608746,0.10344998,0.0073304498,0.046158895,0.08359391,-0.035158772,-0.01749139,-0.0005188688,-0.074309476,-0.040360454,0.0012833091,-0.115123615,0.07674976,0.013052441,0.040672954,0.07035085,0.05590071,-7.185347e-05,0.029382965,-0.007582793,-0.0077994782,0.03649888,-0.054779924,-0.026685571,0.04846759,0.005985596,0.033139788,-0.035734687,0.07166986,0.020524193,-0.04776993,0.018139007,-0.061908465,-0.08487362,-0.014529834,0.12767176,0.030795202,0.008076561,0.003062141,0.024106381,-0.081582785,-0.05164009,0.034357205,0.014277989,-0.06794599,0.0857292,0.03617383,-0.026413068,-0.012474259,0.006613411,-0.0518953,0.014770222,0.03163009,0.009754278,-0.06703442,0.034116175,-0.007543783,0.07451829,0.054814678,0.036540966,-0.0016757739,0.03970261,-0.010977327,0.0028354938,0.019558197,-0.02734829,-0.028819524,0.068204194,-0.04659154,-0.062373158,0.020632803,-0.054836325,0.09856348,-0.09165471,-0.016251817,0.016591277,0.041981094,0.023468485,-0.02286956,-0.015350439,-0.04241898,0.023052288,-0.051557384,0.0551335,-0.053705048,-2.8530934e-33,-0.13787295,0.15548809,-0.0046507856,0.09801669,0.032384753,0.06466575,-0.0086434055,-0.035425134,0.10077918,0.01632365,-0.0321964,-0.0050243745,0.005090556,-0.011521536,0.008035643,-0.04580708,-0.025116857,-0.0434711,-0.042507794,-0.09414711,-0.12788697,0.026223717,-0.059596322,0.016337665,-0.019953946,0.068215236,-0.13094431,-0.04768114,-0.033322733,-0.0084859505,-0.0055020475,-0.016119877,0.035045717,-0.054572325,-0.08792388,-0.026249198,0.09090309,-0.063285366,-0.0045508766,-0.022721933,0.033467505,0.0066145933,-0.018022394,-0.04063017,0.015208788,0.05607995,0.01945083,-0.0025037152,0.0076365205,0.030353945,0.02874224,0.07162155,-0.017326007,-0.05800397,0.045427456,0.013183139,0.00085740496,-0.021903332,-0.09294224,-0.07785547,-0.123563915,-0.048424188,0.021821955,0.044988547,-0.0058057606,-0.026733391,-0.0020023778,-0.1261705,-0.07574653,0.03978631,0.011314956,-0.03473069,-0.015657108,-0.014205031,0.01610694,-0.017588235,-0.057938714,-0.031183107,-0.032714542,0.085291855,0.058868703,-0.070598304,0.039066475,-0.016361594,-0.06435571,0.06497743,-0.017146224,-0.015417918,-0.051208694,0.055339135,-0.14223827,0.021613324,-0.099831395,-0.027424555,0.0058626723,-4.1872205e-08,-0.028234186,-0.02829161,0.040103294,0.023808874,0.04530058,-0.011492595,-0.07868583,0.21387592,-0.046886355,0.041641288,0.010610186,-0.04125371,-0.0834667,0.02232681,0.028566835,-0.009968512,0.042546622,-0.03557103,-0.026472328,-0.04354172,-0.039340865,0.03682915,0.006200492,-0.021167714,0.07352193,-0.0139694745,-0.0128725665,0.1110224,-0.025140204,-0.044189885,0.03034195,-0.014678215,0.013986694,0.012026293,0.0011627061,0.02339466,0.02454372,0.05006961,0.013395455,0.056375377,-0.0147983255,0.052063305,-0.011110517,0.028553424,-0.026582398,0.043135606,-0.022867244,0.041203875,-0.009630297,-0.047532767,0.06211447,-0.046996873,0.028754868,0.0026215815,0.051594857,0.034363177,-0.0112879155,0.005489803,0.07789067,-0.012819295,0.0131612765,-0.058021314,-0.085471004,0.02150616,6,-7.85374,27.392036,8
394,"pivot tables were introduced as a powerful tool for data summarization and analysis. they allow us to dynamically organize, filter, and aggregate data by different categories, making them especially useful for large datasets. we discussed their applications in quickly generating insights, such as identifying trends and patterns. we delved into principal component analysis (pca), focusing on how to derive principal components from original variables while ensuring they remain uncorrelated. finally, we emphasized the role of clear, concise, and insightful reporting in data analysis. a well-structured report should present findings effectively, highlighting key takeaways using visuals and narratives. this ensures that stakeholders can make data-driven decisions

408,"sir started with exploratory data analysis. sir explained them with the example of the session summary we have been uploading. in there data there were length of character in response submitted by each, average length of summary submitted. pivot table- a tool which helps us analyse and summarise data of a column. we get different values computed for a given column of data such as mean max min std dev and other such statistics. this initially gives us some inferences about data which we can use to further process the data.  linear regression is not valid beyond training data. doing exploratory data analysis gives us ideas on what to focus on. statistical summaries, varies kinds of plots can be created using plots. sir then showed how to analyse data of a chemical plant. we have 250 columns and we have to understand nature of these columns. the data has certain parameters at which the plant operates. edge computing- analysis data when we acquire data. sensors getting more advanced that the they acquire and analyse data and give us kind of summary. the pivot table automatically identifies columns like date and time. when we see min and max of data we will find blank or outliers or erroneous data, anomalies. by using this we can remove such data. we can use box plot or scatter plot to identify outliers. in the report of this data analysis, we will give some basic definitions of some metrics, plots and inferences. iqr=q3-q1(75 percentile-25 percentile). outliers will be =q1-1.5*iqr and =q3+1.5*iqr. the factor of 1.5 can be changed as per our requirement. some times we can identify a boundary between outliers and other data based on plots. in some cases the mathematical boundary may not be suitable. so we have to choose accordingly. while plotting we selectively pick some parameters and them analyse them from plots. based on the plots or data we need to ask questions about possible how the data is generated or what process behind that parameter. we can identify relationship between variables, and we can combine them together. we have to ask questions about data and add those into our data. when we get data we will get incorrect incomplete

469,"the class started off by analysing the summary submission data, and we discussed the use of pivot tables, which is a very strong tool for data analysis, and provides us with a lot of insights about the data like the skewness, the minimum and maximum value. we performed a very detailed exploratory data analysis on our submission data, where we went into the depths uptill which student has submitted how many character summary. we then moved on to a different dataset, and tried to extract preliminary insights from it. we discussed a term called as edge computing, which means computing at the end of a particular process. we talked about quartiles again, where we said that they were based on the number of observations and hence they are calculated after the data is sorted. we then created line plots for each and every column of the data, before and after removing outliers. this gives us much information about the trend without outliers and how the outliers are influencing our dataset. we also plot histograms for each column of our dataset which gives us an idea about the distribution of each column data. also, sir mentioned binning, which is the process of converting a continuous variable into discrete variable. correlation heatmaps are a very good way to find relations between different parameters. we can also plot trend line plots which also give us some interesting observations, which can be analysed. we then talked about our assignment 2 submissions and explored some data analysis.

490,"sir started by revising eda,identifying outliers,testing hypothesis , sir then showed eda of the summary data which we fill after every class in which he told avg word count was approx 1.2k. sir then introduced pivot tables and their practical applications . he showed the application on a real life problem of chemical plant which had approx 250 parameters , and various plots  were made like histogram of different parameters and mostly it followed normal distribution except for a few outliers  h sir related this issue with nvidia stock spikes at the end ta came to discuss exercise 2 of

514,"today's lecture started with a discussion of the objectives of exploratory data analysis, which are to gain insights, identify anomalies, test hypotheses, and validate assumptions. we then looked at a dataset of course summary submissions from previous lectures, looking at features such as the length of each submission. some of the entries were much longer than others, suggesting potential outliers.  we used pivot tables to analyse this data.
then, we examined a problem of real interest involving optimization for a chemical plant, where several parameters were analysed through various plots. among the observations was a distribution that seemed to be normal, except for some odd readings at the low extreme, perhaps caused by faulty sensors. but instead of throwing them away, the value of domain knowledge was highlighted, with a mention

549,"in todays class (19/2/25), we learnt about the use of pivot tables. calculating max, min, average, sum and how mean deviates from the min and max. creating charts and understanding that how the tasks can be simplified using the pivot table in excel rather going for python codes. we carried out the following task using 2 case studies, 1 about our summaries and other was about the chemical plant which was having a lot of data around 241 columns. in a line, we performed eda using pivot tables and also learnt about the use of different charts to find the outliers, people with giving summary of 6k+ characters to 71 characters. finally delved into the discussion about exercise 2 assignment and ended the

574,"we discussed  about eda today through various case studies. the first  case study was on our summary data itself where we learnt how to use pivot tables in the excel, here we could perform various operations like finding mean of the data , max, min of the columns. its a great tool and makes life easier during eda when we have small datasets because excel is interactive. we also used the data analysis tool of the excel to get the summary statistics of the data set. we discussed how the outliers could be made out in different methods like we were able to see the in box plot lying above and below the whiskers , in scatter plot they were lying very far from the actual data which formed a band and in histogram where we could see some skewness confirming presence of outliers. we then saw the eda report of the chemical factory and transformers. and learnt how to present the data and how to pose relevant questions to the clients based on the missing data and preliminary data analysis through eda. here we saw the relevance of using line plots to find the outliers and plotting them pairwise to know there corelation etc. thus in conclusion we learnt how important eda is how to do it effectively. after this the ta's discussed about the last assignment. the key points of the discussion were writing the report in well structured manner and using the right tool as mentioned in the question and learnt how to introduce noise in the data.

577,"we started with pivot tables in excel. we learned how pivot tables help to summarize large collections of data by grouping and totaling values. we learned how to create a pivot table in excel, drag and drop fields, and calculate measurements like sum, average, count, and percentages to effectively analyze data.

then we moved on to other eda (exploratory data analysis) methods. we talked about how summary statistics like mean, median, variance, and standard deviation give an idea of the data. we also covered visualization methods like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to identify trends, skewness, and outliers.

lastly, we touched on how data issues like class imbalance could impact analysis. when one of the classes significantly outweighs all the rest, it can skew results. we also did a quick overview of feature engineering and transformation, which are utilized to assist in improving data quality before analysis.",-0.025452081,0.018334525,0.020087816,-0.04382257,-0.015305765,0.0076925107,-0.08438038,0.07260309,0.0048103854,0.06277751,-0.04334026,0.05513847,0.03189774,0.00024029672,-0.02422935,-0.0034611956,0.045852084,0.067178026,-0.0542564,-0.01808868,-0.005019677,-0.037094224,-0.029721383,0.019023614,0.025960086,0.040673293,0.027561003,-0.033672348,-0.0740217,-0.08402581,-0.03650178,0.042640608,0.012239717,0.026247501,-0.15084158,-0.016946053,0.08418376,0.095517404,0.024964787,-0.03147866,-0.027837735,-0.0044212053,0.033674505,-0.013101423,0.033444718,-0.045746133,-0.0564048,-0.10795053,0.002858807,0.02066167,-0.08621967,0.038021434,0.04840159,0.00417356,0.025332762,0.0010471679,0.027464049,-0.051817518,0.04517927,0.0029736904,-0.026354246,-0.012827875,0.0578116,0.0022133202,-0.009721473,-0.07105535,0.04601776,0.057874292,0.0092638945,0.018434456,-0.015396601,0.061351936,-0.094424896,0.027137723,0.047212943,0.074063934,-0.089436136,-0.027753444,-0.0034734586,0.014060789,-0.0128584625,0.05704934,-0.045107998,0.10133287,0.087396495,-0.010407908,0.024694031,0.010229368,-0.08186823,0.018325651,0.016526412,0.062190168,0.06208425,0.011168,-0.009697333,0.04414365,-0.056313768,-0.13350603,0.07044035,0.02405915,-0.011715783,0.022665007,-0.010463739,-0.10170348,-0.027921231,-0.13314682,0.08159727,-0.035553113,-0.03620236,-0.0521423,0.028552037,-0.0697031,-0.10133116,-0.04491212,0.014154346,-0.04204459,-0.015523361,-0.02046658,-0.052324135,0.010961361,0.00042272077,0.00026598814,-0.0043925466,0.07689755,0.06386322,0.027499234,-0.122405216,2.7010922e-33,0.018693373,-0.018052647,-0.017048609,0.08806502,0.028790753,-0.07265563,-0.014954338,0.0013942176,0.016024183,0.013513011,0.047394037,0.20273201,0.032180052,0.0775103,0.060947996,0.021977335,-0.040595304,0.037964374,-0.034339167,0.0035886427,-0.040623605,-0.12180422,0.109598175,-0.001568065,0.024291772,0.07333053,-0.030565068,0.0046872674,0.022099422,-0.01438516,0.0048066154,-0.039192144,-0.021839593,-0.011487334,0.01798147,-0.038272604,-0.009574555,-0.002454859,0.051487584,0.085086666,-0.04976003,0.0116962595,-0.023100756,-0.03080111,0.021798035,0.10461294,0.017755631,-0.00857451,0.06697428,0.0017195772,0.016554195,-0.10355573,0.049474858,0.037631948,-0.073787384,0.05341725,-0.04292036,-0.072030455,-0.018816436,-0.0062585627,-0.04227433,0.06088516,0.031186037,-0.056119822,-0.06419522,-0.009855841,-0.03549593,0.068331145,0.009722907,-0.022382984,0.0042831497,-0.011314859,-0.07885575,0.045695756,0.060718607,0.00492692,0.0053701685,0.036370337,-0.020830987,-0.00066113455,0.037953198,-0.06976532,0.064679444,-0.09963877,-0.043138172,0.014641098,0.05542966,0.024284987,0.002753442,-0.007650697,-0.01221044,0.019903533,-0.0440567,0.060726557,-0.0035391017,-3.4455282e-33,-0.08969021,0.109451406,-0.06235305,0.03042686,0.08825391,0.053587023,-0.012825999,-0.03138523,0.051315095,-0.03758306,-0.07599856,-0.07773321,0.003575832,-0.023042344,0.02142717,-0.046376,-0.0009519642,-0.07844732,-0.06468292,-0.032552958,-0.004416804,0.059162673,-0.033401884,-0.016482469,-0.028987797,0.039150465,-0.1142569,-0.031077582,-0.012365823,0.006968837,-0.018507054,-0.038276367,0.015002089,0.024757624,-0.091968425,0.02674054,0.02703697,-0.089415245,0.051542886,0.034674376,0.04600828,0.008191647,0.050013456,-0.0046626623,0.017942939,0.028727332,0.023592751,0.08576883,-0.006915253,0.0595863,0.0043179183,0.09618619,0.0049411217,0.01444866,0.070842385,-0.045472138,0.11922279,-0.03588962,-0.050789513,0.07106479,-0.09944453,0.012085015,-0.018803412,0.020148508,-0.046390887,-0.008788967,0.050193727,-0.11456818,-0.08695117,0.04060045,0.038522277,0.0012855552,-0.005182274,-0.07269159,0.016089102,0.048830107,-0.058817208,0.037031207,-0.05055457,-0.0032553049,0.014297192,-0.096643806,0.020486847,-0.029895222,-0.01262229,0.07696575,0.023544604,-0.048086293,0.022921683,0.060468294,-0.10425967,-0.05350499,-0.052794732,-0.004452036,0.017262269,-4.753985e-08,-0.0053110975,0.0040866155,0.023331173,0.049610022,0.015266357,-0.075160645,-0.029583173,0.19581069,0.00893671,0.008687264,0.06766421,-0.0018961898,-0.045740813,0.0044011357,0.11840494,0.078758776,0.029757483,0.0647746,-0.017658165,0.013142499,-0.023987204,-0.063158415,-0.058947787,-0.007872401,0.017491741,-0.037902102,0.010362174,0.06539125,0.0030640936,-0.0009919446,0.00045030587,0.020232523,-0.006484082,-0.019187847,0.042456746,0.002808326,0.043917667,0.0064234245,-0.022136359,0.04371698,-0.06702251,0.091621466,-0.04666454,-0.00044356048,0.016774345,0.036966678,-0.059650935,0.008181698,0.04242848,-0.017105995,0.019948335,-0.04914732,0.018899921,0.016703788,-0.01649847,0.09002369,0.019434255,-0.045710206,0.06579047,-0.01930077,0.02317411,0.0076287403,-0.06757257,0.028415423,6,-5.890587,27.865696,8
578,"in this class, much was not done. we moved further in exploratory data analysis and basically studied on outliers. we referered to 2 or more problems regarding fault in transformer etc and how data collection can help me create a good explanatory data set. later we moved to, how we should deal with outliers. there were several times when the outliers were 0 or very far away from the actual data. we just remove them directly to avoid unnecessary deviations. later, it was shown how various huge numbers of columns of data can be converted to minimum data size with the help of principal component analysis and on the basis of independent variables. it was shown how very heavy data file of more than 200 columns were converted to only 17 principle components and how other columns were clustered together due to some kind of clustering in between

590,"our first focus was on pivot tables in excel, and how they assist in summarizing datasets by sorting and grouping values. we learned how to build the pivot tables, how to set fields by dragging and dropping, and how to calculate totals, averages, count etc in order to analyze data .

then we studied different eda techniques. we calculated summary statistics such as mean and median, variance, and standard deviation in order to understand the dataâ€™s distribution. we also studied some tools of visualization like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to see how they help to show patterns and shapes of distribution and outliers within a dataset.

we also discussed the analysis issue where one category of class dominates the other. lastly, we touched upon feature engineering and data transformation techniques that are needed to improve data quality before any further analysis is performed.",0.018457612,-0.0125926,0.045290805,-0.05564243,-0.049836274,-0.036167394,-0.061576303,0.02806622,-0.052147333,0.043584887,-0.005264479,0.03710488,0.03611704,-0.020958679,-0.023280608,0.011061346,0.062268313,0.034320626,-0.08140893,-0.021323876,-0.00663179,-0.01541494,-0.02582151,-0.0137553485,0.06829322,0.055456877,0.04307106,-0.02218002,-0.044080324,-0.09887753,-0.061300073,0.019996164,0.0049272384,0.043046102,-0.1052763,-0.022446971,0.078663774,0.04950399,0.05236582,-0.0133579895,-0.020969639,0.02108308,0.0618477,-0.022405311,0.0122618545,-0.008337213,-0.09436428,-0.08819095,0.017769432,0.01984139,-0.08417089,0.040651415,0.011044656,0.05989013,0.0017716379,0.009024289,0.038579606,-0.051277347,0.0423895,-0.023711897,-0.035925765,-0.0025560232,0.06247143,0.023516614,-0.011597485,-0.056289844,0.044942286,0.08119294,0.04422679,-0.009119817,-0.033686407,0.083782755,-0.09038872,0.056429774,-0.018153064,0.039874364,-0.10108639,-0.026522048,-0.012585479,-0.05150016,-0.014446599,0.054570958,-0.038666602,0.107130155,0.07352103,-0.026715998,0.014574559,-0.00852661,-0.10441709,0.03597305,-0.03263222,0.07626174,0.0786469,0.015904626,-0.040732544,0.021000074,0.029441746,-0.10725758,0.05641105,0.05959603,-0.017157272,0.02450991,-0.01971483,-0.11453133,-0.023163255,-0.10453638,0.06363016,-0.016851077,-0.034243442,-0.045144826,0.029305136,-0.049059693,-0.13096724,-0.07555197,-0.010186308,-0.029725727,-0.03683355,0.019940995,-0.026207983,-0.030706607,0.007908117,0.013888594,-0.002809428,0.062528044,0.05022965,0.040327244,-0.058625083,3.294836e-33,0.023463666,-0.06191416,-0.029050287,0.051138155,0.06044168,-0.035511747,-0.024585547,-0.007305498,0.022644661,0.02269301,0.007267627,0.1567211,-0.002261032,0.06997419,0.03666157,-0.023595538,0.0022061754,0.05814287,-0.087893575,0.015199219,-0.030464485,-0.07094911,0.09852082,-0.02073888,0.0023916815,0.04992054,-0.042850103,0.0009337446,0.01192734,0.005900833,-0.037711505,-0.024499418,0.0021804583,0.0055701677,0.0042930306,-0.04307525,0.023967832,-0.05484791,0.13537136,0.10147713,-0.006982212,-0.016892802,-0.061574537,-0.037914652,0.011123769,0.14085211,0.036912933,0.003019746,0.070211,-0.04782961,-0.010271865,-0.113794826,0.094756864,0.058929928,-0.038574908,0.035656184,-0.015956137,-0.08347266,-0.004385505,0.022083087,-0.04253283,0.077375405,0.0075803376,-0.0052361963,-0.053075567,-0.0464803,-0.0020973713,0.058207765,0.02456314,-0.037277054,-0.0027371284,0.011721831,-0.061163373,0.039561797,0.065360434,0.04712957,0.018061295,0.07502865,-0.032784395,-0.047350787,0.02406689,-0.058235895,0.049589425,-0.10001464,-0.056979608,0.021291174,0.04573044,0.04862854,-0.025865294,-0.0016575917,-0.02444504,0.060384907,0.0061896327,0.021181745,0.021547114,-3.8026937e-33,-0.1078185,0.15711462,-0.033855487,0.057518687,0.052374046,0.04135227,-0.047511026,-0.014701304,0.07727786,0.01954937,-0.09005534,-0.08922112,0.022499291,-0.095418885,0.016947864,-0.020761585,0.00092587894,-0.04942193,-0.06482114,-0.04976004,-0.0016224777,0.08053017,-0.0696177,0.004456672,-0.04039607,0.023876475,-0.09715054,-0.035210986,-0.03175784,-0.0034424139,0.0095210085,-0.0021983725,-0.0004922922,-0.0024107369,-0.0849055,-0.014303495,0.01905687,-0.084727444,0.00033757344,0.055537462,-0.0010945498,0.015551376,0.011359667,0.0030196744,0.03953748,0.022340333,0.008035292,0.06267404,-0.0039829053,0.006784519,-0.006148606,0.08887163,0.0077878064,0.0039106333,0.057946112,-0.026916785,0.094000906,-0.032954473,-0.025252024,0.02033895,-0.070843585,-0.007390735,0.033378165,0.035392217,-0.039442047,-0.021813529,0.020217873,-0.096189424,-0.08806419,0.028070359,0.05044793,-0.053648997,-0.015596104,-0.07417545,-0.009653655,0.015891232,-0.026722185,0.014852697,0.009578537,0.017227931,0.045653902,-0.072026856,0.037535254,0.036068257,-0.021233438,0.10627891,0.01569172,-0.020130487,0.032096867,0.091126695,-0.096856825,-0.07200991,-0.059501786,0.009163734,0.04365861,-4.6963436e-08,-0.0058980566,-0.0151376175,0.00444072,0.008139593,0.02168597,-0.05462805,-0.012258653,0.24313362,-0.016864924,0.0058504557,0.049303576,-0.02044931,-0.06978872,-0.0019383755,0.12149442,0.09257851,0.03438855,0.064254664,-0.016391221,0.009810727,0.03751442,-0.052743766,0.027736785,-0.013440851,0.0048753656,-0.03605056,0.02280688,0.055049855,0.016031172,0.021749642,-0.0035536059,-0.01277245,-0.009200189,-0.032159537,0.033980217,0.019542933,0.0134315705,0.028271358,-0.07220257,0.034602784,-0.061144665,0.051912136,-0.027767593,0.03320569,-0.0035146764,0.024269741,0.0130887525,0.0070503936,0.045843728,-0.020959571,-0.022110358,-0.064254746,-0.0031348718,-0.021099517,-0.038730778,0.084608294,-0.038367674,-0.008305686,0.07746681,-0.05262613,0.023216186,0.0026464046,-0.06812614,0.028795743,6,-6.0993752,27.511772,8
639,"in this class, we performed exploratory data analysis on our summary data collected. we discussed a few functions of the pivot table and how it can be helpful, as well as a little more convenient than to code. we performed some analysis on our outlier data using multiple graphs to get inferences on the outlier nature.

652,"today were started by looking into eda again, but with our session summary data. we were told about pivot table which provides us with data like skewness, max min and more. using these we can make some inferences. we spent some time in this using the session summary data as mentioned. then we headed on how to treat outliners a bit and we were advised not too totally discard them as the question why this outliner arises too is valuable and can give us insights.
then the tas came and gave us the insights on the reports of e2.",-0.05856844,-0.00713258,0.040715206,-0.0120770205,0.043021318,0.015684491,-0.034178637,0.10226619,0.036412645,0.06323885,0.009717157,-0.0029492148,-0.06642272,-0.009900482,-0.0013395933,-0.035024736,0.026554419,-0.062576294,-0.05870003,-0.043384865,0.033206455,0.025156572,-0.046803378,-0.0065380647,0.0055904617,0.056713365,-0.020895803,-0.015443278,-0.018895129,-0.11273599,0.042049974,0.07499111,-0.0180438,0.0009669447,-0.014873788,-0.07766467,0.06481852,0.037233885,0.02854242,-0.033866394,-0.014117789,0.00979123,-0.008108273,-0.007798705,0.038576614,-0.05091331,-0.05197236,-0.055688705,-0.0485177,0.009325951,-0.029747501,-0.025698626,0.0607712,-0.024239754,0.041034296,0.051138416,-0.0016309696,-0.0413815,-0.022725547,0.035034228,-0.05396493,-0.06547521,0.038974427,-0.022880977,0.05055932,0.018387605,0.06516658,-0.0482477,0.006987317,0.057113368,-0.059158042,0.012319489,-0.12949838,0.04242983,0.057711773,0.019284567,-0.07069091,0.018176368,0.047064584,-0.12909847,-0.029131675,0.041482408,-0.06111491,0.02593091,0.014626631,-0.02559438,0.047601238,-0.058929205,-0.01692633,0.08874082,0.094854526,-0.021609161,0.07583687,0.084116355,-0.007123576,-0.010720686,-0.023330115,-0.04374704,0.07097162,0.019364491,-0.001984166,0.08295327,-0.08228446,-0.050403677,-0.114737794,-0.08727153,0.06782576,-0.029278321,-0.030606417,-0.0085295625,0.050529037,0.01611724,-0.061076656,-0.017866768,-0.019534077,-0.08565679,0.026568072,0.0074371207,0.090709865,0.009817316,-0.014719637,0.00517462,-0.004447567,0.10067493,0.0064864783,-0.049036507,-0.12827876,4.5724673e-33,0.019637985,0.014849089,-0.05530642,0.009883458,-0.0063788076,0.037370875,-0.07490072,-0.022004368,0.03327391,-0.06325631,-0.036003165,0.09830437,0.040439274,0.08469593,0.025031883,-0.060958214,-0.01645771,0.09869279,-0.09062515,-0.026452053,0.0128165735,-0.0388114,0.0700087,-0.09264778,0.039122976,0.024915801,-0.06940448,-0.0024327154,0.031635657,0.0016477015,-0.0031775895,-0.095517404,0.003870569,0.0302334,0.030014655,0.0240227,0.057790857,0.0074855834,0.063290596,0.019769797,0.026668154,0.08850793,0.0706235,-0.030659845,-0.039608326,0.028790422,0.02693817,-0.011076453,0.010522676,-0.050033342,0.04314693,-0.064853534,0.041757986,-0.004172158,0.016529901,-0.0025880137,-0.07779846,0.0016936322,0.057103727,0.015753806,0.031254586,0.102914676,-0.041949037,-0.057084814,-0.052417688,0.03947695,-0.06378167,-0.037830826,0.027471809,0.0039935233,0.0005491053,0.026249412,0.07079311,0.039751984,0.04071173,-0.05109126,-0.044125732,0.056754984,0.019743433,0.0006015358,-0.02955674,0.015981868,0.049023084,-0.099738985,-0.07374065,-0.079052515,0.047331627,0.01304027,-0.03821612,0.060796935,0.002436784,-0.002618835,0.0034365316,0.06281482,0.05018997,-5.529663e-33,-0.05640013,0.05980553,0.02565459,-0.013038235,-0.019151136,0.002607668,-0.03083819,0.0068756863,0.045845892,-0.065002486,0.0039705667,-0.017902346,0.016263733,-0.013483642,0.0568672,-0.059816226,0.0066652903,-0.06335526,0.030752942,-0.05097456,0.07708182,-0.016585734,-0.098497696,0.015537597,0.058960993,0.0087854015,-0.051520206,-0.034213994,-0.037902102,-0.061318956,-0.014657502,-0.057047006,-0.055143602,0.015981749,-0.0599662,-0.039969586,-0.02179907,-0.051389333,0.021719275,0.012860534,0.031580087,0.042539936,0.028471371,0.040169757,-0.007894146,0.0039611845,0.03284721,0.16476473,-0.05810975,0.006326621,0.0293671,0.042287484,-0.019849725,-0.011829171,0.019355042,0.013477344,0.041530248,-0.11600852,-0.057893004,0.030935794,0.036791526,0.07295364,-0.05339522,0.032106556,0.0642373,-0.04221961,0.010655083,-0.0728578,-0.06638666,0.0070510497,0.05524352,-0.10155765,-0.06843965,-0.057912547,0.07675147,0.039093748,-0.07676957,-0.0103411125,-0.016168084,0.005861858,-0.10092818,-0.027115209,0.031771146,-0.019362794,0.030888878,0.07189225,-0.03505351,-0.038399674,0.030888576,0.074360274,-0.028345037,-0.12413682,0.010088118,0.06046359,-0.02676531,-5.1546635e-08,-0.006527102,-0.062478416,0.016377097,0.047115568,0.0035866676,-0.081087835,0.03507134,0.17633536,-0.023505345,0.04689859,0.027345989,-0.053422965,-0.08578934,-0.014663036,0.15530108,0.07576698,0.053284425,0.11370588,-0.044224415,-0.013988755,0.01820369,0.0070936414,-0.03710507,-0.034850273,-0.00060789566,0.06408835,0.046795692,0.113276064,-0.01889861,0.016010324,-0.008543919,0.02721043,0.029643113,-0.005063724,0.021982066,0.022224069,0.004696434,0.026853772,-0.016667515,0.038156442,-0.026733924,0.0060063647,0.025327655,0.032182615,0.073192716,0.017038425,-0.06219713,0.01713897,0.0079293735,-0.124712735,0.0010018673,-0.06022897,0.022000475,0.022553466,-0.05739596,0.03250065,0.005966279,-0.004649732,0.0068604336,-0.02664448,0.111116834,0.011679737,-0.10297697,0.08047161,6,-2.5583003,30.12664,8
656,"in todayâ€™s session, the instructor provided a detailed tutorial on using pivot tables to conduct exploratory data analysis (eda). the session began with a hands-on demonstration of pivot table functions applied to our summary analysis, where we explored plots of averages, maximums, and minimums, such as analyzing the number of words in summaries. this practical approach enabled us to see firsthand how pivot tables can reveal underlying data trends and discrepancies.

building on that, the instructor delved into broader aspects of eda, discussing various techniques and strategies for handling different types of challenges encountered during data exploration. he emphasized that understanding the nuances of eda is critical for diagnosing data issues, cleaning datasets, and ensuring the accuracy of the analysis. key points included methods for managing missing values, outliers, and other common data irregularities that can skew results.

the session then transitioned to a real-world demonstration, where the instructor showcased eda on datasets from a chemical plant and a solar plant project he had worked on. through this demonstration, he illustrated how comprehensive data analysis, when well-documented and carefully presented, can drive insightful decision-making and operational improvements. the importance of creating clear, detailed reports was highlighted, ensuring that the insights derived from eda are accessible and actionable for stakeholders.

finally, the teaching assistant supplemented the session with a presentation on exercise e2, further reinforcing the practical application of the techniques discussed.",-0.032519948,0.035292856,0.023840727,-0.0017666336,-0.017971475,-0.012709872,-0.028301796,0.056045115,-0.02617126,0.058208596,-0.010934801,0.0074225385,0.0575692,0.007054985,-0.06363405,0.019536724,-0.017994279,0.022574209,-0.064032465,-0.03649092,-0.004353193,-0.005329066,-0.01992705,0.013076391,0.034641426,0.085272186,-0.026727688,-0.015526319,-0.04899184,-0.03901607,-0.028328646,0.12040067,0.04129499,0.03632351,-0.022726059,0.0070338706,0.005461655,0.06828756,0.034866806,0.0017133275,-0.06028444,-0.07041031,0.018467342,0.008430673,0.016881486,-0.038148835,-0.058752745,-0.107603535,-0.008336731,-0.0180566,-0.10791937,0.009815674,0.009225665,-0.020630654,0.013481844,0.0019791436,0.0027264447,-0.028652959,0.030399164,-0.0046756216,-0.031303592,-0.054974396,-0.0071234754,0.021631906,0.03133581,-0.053691454,-0.009300829,-0.0093693305,0.0146305105,0.060022485,-0.054576494,0.06999708,-0.09466204,0.04401821,-0.015635613,0.049209405,-0.03140143,-0.0060608597,0.0032540082,-0.062314153,0.019997934,0.07208829,-0.04963613,0.06368938,0.048901867,-0.025902167,0.02203268,0.012613972,0.032754507,0.0142812,0.02161066,0.007709728,0.059721537,0.0016792457,0.023401616,0.012481992,-0.01998182,-0.0784268,0.051128246,0.04706452,0.042353947,0.07536061,-0.04659465,-0.14467679,-0.11890453,-0.11543321,0.030442338,0.00092075573,-0.008975535,-0.039826177,-0.037202574,-0.04602777,-0.059647303,-0.029829204,-0.010569522,-0.05838807,-0.019836029,-0.038593084,-0.028204514,-0.007865713,0.018591015,-0.010022189,0.056057297,0.09289194,0.039081834,0.029509353,-0.036561895,4.7045352e-33,0.050429873,-0.014250775,0.0005507885,0.08411622,0.025415001,-0.00517285,-0.026786035,-0.024104344,-0.047312487,0.06282673,0.048759602,0.17464142,-0.015267028,0.06433409,0.029122198,0.029635018,-0.019443288,0.037603706,-0.067404084,-0.035973385,0.0069478173,-0.11827162,0.073526435,-0.037385028,0.035983033,0.07852416,0.037519466,-0.026665144,0.04154263,-0.014461119,-0.019241432,-0.062618434,0.009097789,0.0065358286,0.048234068,-0.0060360334,0.04059618,-0.06925364,0.0629917,0.09131497,-0.020173088,0.072436675,0.021464655,-0.0127104465,-0.0056462497,0.10097571,0.031191502,0.02537399,0.035347246,0.010736949,-0.011703986,-0.022035947,0.08803679,0.02922873,-0.016415218,0.021440202,-0.05206,-0.08606759,0.01531451,0.024685182,-0.025565326,0.095739014,-0.012385153,-0.009164362,-0.094040096,0.07982428,-0.09025376,0.08854014,0.05471997,0.021218596,-0.041422788,-0.029015308,-0.020414,-0.017037673,0.088182464,-0.011456044,0.012667415,0.0044973977,-0.014760389,-0.016482383,0.0639435,-0.04858949,0.060558215,-0.088834904,-0.13761407,-0.067353204,0.03696642,-0.011964956,0.0013011977,-0.043126583,-0.00939421,-0.009424184,-0.049694296,0.035808448,0.06524825,-5.8577198e-33,-0.090533614,0.07525638,-0.02969442,0.017174857,0.07021746,0.008973238,-0.049492765,-0.07419939,0.098237775,-0.07969888,-0.0743528,-0.058426123,0.013347494,-0.03233181,0.005186084,-0.013008271,-0.008646553,-0.044002295,-0.06470536,0.026139667,-0.023544902,0.06457866,-0.07160209,-0.0064101596,-0.020623326,0.059591882,0.0055636996,-0.06548779,-0.037240185,-0.06187841,0.014707447,-0.07638368,-0.023028154,0.014483655,-0.09211505,0.022421243,0.05063113,-0.12699868,-0.009312515,0.043470852,0.07692734,0.014479303,0.029984009,0.0027759855,-0.00046345821,-0.0059052804,-0.028673122,0.035658523,-0.028945725,0.047253925,-0.009360414,0.02519952,-0.0010071597,-0.029620854,0.06574234,-0.077798046,0.06407695,-0.029973682,-0.07520707,0.0056781056,-0.016273564,0.023931468,-0.002541765,0.03921026,-0.05368267,-0.04347449,0.04088465,-0.07164443,-0.07343361,0.053766977,-0.014127554,-0.0038039063,-0.038200215,-0.08626348,0.057477124,0.05935736,-0.09659577,-0.035421632,-0.047381975,-0.01585168,0.010570199,-0.055147886,0.057036996,0.0108412905,0.0058844914,0.08193581,-0.009954679,0.0021822888,-0.010011738,0.082693376,-0.09104403,-0.101227716,-0.066506386,0.06725488,0.03262224,-5.2905477e-08,-0.021772323,0.015967596,-0.02906594,0.010216279,0.025792923,-0.08546272,0.025479836,0.15351035,-0.03895346,-0.010240774,0.09468295,-0.014228747,-0.026597708,0.029354706,0.11457662,0.06077033,0.078036696,0.037287876,-0.035815816,0.019352015,0.035610694,0.034859363,-0.070626765,-0.047011074,0.0166502,-0.019044932,-0.00075122016,0.15009038,-0.020922158,-0.07038729,0.03281259,-0.0150138745,-0.00494324,-0.016985817,0.044927306,0.04088567,0.045135587,0.013885426,-0.01193553,-0.01148559,-0.13523927,0.06883047,0.014756722,0.037291784,-0.028234338,0.068002075,-0.12458401,0.02803006,0.039084297,-0.054941427,-0.010919442,-0.0576732,0.016961867,0.017026918,0.051658593,0.10082317,0.03480713,0.023230797,-0.008350179,-0.020689236,0.0347817,0.03316746,-0.10703817,0.042808995,6,-4.9848366,29.586134,8
