33,"in today's session proff discussed about mid sem exam and how to approach the problem. he started with describing the problem and how some of the datas were missing and inconsistent, then he started solving the question by doing eda, then how to deal with outliers and by analysis we concluded that there is no need of clustering as there were many parameters and then made the correlation matrix using which only 6 of the parameters were truly independent. also for the second part  the model made in first part was not applicable to second one as they were for different population.
then ta told about e3 assignment and in last 15 minutes sir briefly discussed about curse of dimensionality due to which there was increase in sparsity, complexity.
and at last we discussed about vif vs r square graph

64,"we looked at f1 matrix, confusion matrix, also we need to check if the confusion matrix has actual numbers in the table, either by checking the documentation or the data. 
a very frequent problem which we face is having a cleaned and sane dataset, hence we looked at how a general data analysis problem can go on, then we looked at crisp-dm and overview of itâ€™s six steps. the ta shubham sir then explained how the data can be collected and cleaned, and explained the concept of outliers, when the data is actually an outlier (for eg seasonal demand and festivities), and their importance, and that we cannot simply ignore them. we discussed how mean, medience are related to outliers and how they are affected by it

83,"the session began with a discussion on the mid-semester exam, where the professor went over the solutions, clarifying key concepts and addressing doubts. this was followed by the ta providing feedback on the exercise, highlighting common mistakes and areas for improvement. after these discussions, the professor moved on to teaching two important topics in machine learning and statistics.

the first topic covered was the variance inflation factor (vif), a measure used to detect multicollinearity in regression models. the professor explained that vif is defined as  represents the coefficient of determination obtained by regressing a feature on all other features. a high vif value indicates strong collinearity, which can negatively impact model performance by making coefficient estimates unreliable. understanding vif is crucial in regression analysis to ensure that independent variables are not excessively correlated.

the second topic discussed was the curse of dimensionality, a fundamental challenge in machine learning that arises when working with high-dimensional data. the professor explained that as the number of dimensions increases, data points become more sparse, making it harder to identify meaningful patterns. additionally, high-dimensional datasets increase model complexity, often leading to overfitting and poor generalization to new data. the computational cost of processing such datasets also rises significantly, requiring more time and resources. another major issue is distance distortion, where the concept of ""distance"" between data points becomes less meaningful, making it difficult to distinguish between nearest and farthest neighbors. the session emphasized the importance of addressing these challenges through techniques like feature selection and dimensionality reduction to improve model efficiency and

90,today in class we analysed the data of the previous submitted summaries of the sessions and plotted it in a graph. also at the end there was feeback about the assignments submitted and what are the possible points where we can improve while plotting graph.,0.004620173,0.038638577,-0.022746751,-0.05141962,0.0046737804,0.019046895,-0.006142971,-0.010836598,0.010016651,0.056434702,-0.022924535,0.07242681,0.0042321277,0.036293324,0.009345621,-0.04707834,0.006600065,-0.022775797,-0.02423664,-0.0762737,0.0032497859,-0.03427391,-0.01720499,0.016705696,0.07356154,0.026111491,0.013112768,0.019111292,0.077176504,-0.08196101,-0.08977446,0.01570791,0.053399708,0.021824528,-0.03081702,-0.036901392,-0.028874641,0.07785692,0.066534325,0.005246953,-0.06452931,0.042998154,0.06591938,0.041058216,0.016350022,-0.0112504,-0.07790397,-0.06543365,-0.014705588,0.027185883,-0.018340483,0.032701347,-0.0073335245,-0.06142569,-0.014890189,0.007609887,0.00050607347,-0.08184532,0.031570334,-0.017278118,0.0113399215,0.02837044,-0.00032954584,0.033547673,0.03930409,-0.018587932,0.03164257,0.049319617,0.06278931,0.11854212,0.006024471,-0.013566756,-0.0423823,-0.07017449,-0.02124577,0.02142003,-0.04096865,0.04584395,-0.056895193,-0.1441841,0.039093234,-0.021749273,0.005939737,0.06445766,-0.049741294,-0.057157207,0.015232435,0.0013589426,-0.014683122,0.021323305,-0.041637342,0.098323494,-0.07425539,0.044048447,-0.038802087,0.07375395,0.04296522,0.097065605,0.107696354,0.10987496,0.042702142,0.005301204,-0.037675507,0.0017334882,-0.041369475,-0.013609793,0.024951464,-0.008975627,-0.032587584,0.0051977937,-0.0055322447,0.026108248,-0.0748755,0.08563246,0.107993044,-0.038721047,0.047410112,-0.021195274,-0.11405723,0.054238565,0.055843342,0.046293844,0.0031126814,-0.0058336724,-0.034585323,-0.06111181,-0.0037474858,1.74016e-34,0.039411265,-0.05052719,-0.04086031,-0.0025636614,0.025649931,0.035322342,-0.08499525,-0.018251842,0.023797762,0.03590644,-0.060264982,0.04050679,0.051676176,0.021396747,-0.0093909055,-0.048076507,0.008504791,0.04882,-0.075035125,0.008722425,-0.013372272,-0.074565336,0.08934006,0.007219191,0.06583117,0.12010761,0.033833284,0.027972309,-0.0049850475,0.015778257,0.028801106,-0.0064714453,-0.033247586,-0.02732384,0.011589362,-0.010298954,0.06160923,-0.007093409,0.08670517,-0.030732006,-0.0046507786,0.013414405,0.0040941164,-0.030290347,-0.091707185,0.043479007,-0.027232638,0.011036847,0.02485416,0.044479623,-0.12808932,-0.036188178,0.004770892,-0.019304529,-0.042149894,0.041300043,0.04747326,-0.0050865035,-0.07007312,0.06968164,0.02526478,-0.004261842,-0.07948079,-0.058781955,-0.07738904,0.0071107578,-0.10353873,0.01251022,0.07343831,-0.03629146,-0.1116178,0.04717039,-0.013509812,-0.001612717,0.06194257,0.0066863294,-0.03344946,0.08559931,-0.07971258,-2.534593e-05,-0.03789342,-0.11389217,-0.017885434,-0.097347304,-0.013680638,-0.05947368,0.073881574,0.0084560625,-0.017173681,0.021213759,-0.042216912,0.011000237,-0.016193805,0.08392462,0.045629892,-1.9494975e-33,-0.06753221,0.16623563,-0.02488477,0.09112041,0.043697327,0.04942695,0.03302682,-0.054518543,0.015501152,0.035323743,-0.047961418,-0.06053975,0.012363787,0.022888776,-0.0018844269,-0.007130362,-0.05529715,-0.041668504,-0.028929925,-0.04641001,-0.017951554,0.100703776,-0.008082216,-0.09328746,0.065931514,0.047353633,-0.042368736,-0.08506296,-0.050124466,-0.01476111,-0.008495048,-0.04139154,-0.08749665,0.015396174,0.014351979,0.030117052,0.11376532,-0.0601992,-0.013876829,0.053761892,0.07895304,-0.005518095,-0.01164753,-0.042492185,0.017505493,0.08058181,-0.079756804,0.062533624,-0.002605512,0.061595313,-0.029081594,0.033189688,0.018027525,-0.04616683,0.010229604,-0.08624261,0.08130229,-0.024561448,-0.013436834,-0.007147197,-0.070642106,-0.021784041,0.00417522,-0.001600164,0.027577369,-0.04306339,0.018123541,-0.10103937,0.008287943,0.09131614,0.056662288,-0.011885242,-0.027803367,-0.002947207,0.13147578,0.024625229,-0.040930692,0.01106814,-0.024175065,-0.012651034,-0.014354706,-0.003912221,0.03526132,0.05109545,-0.02550141,0.07176417,-0.000115766794,0.046216287,-0.0043455437,0.017290412,-0.05582525,0.019385803,-0.06999631,-0.021132248,0.055600494,-3.7524384e-08,-0.113059334,-0.102109134,-0.004592481,0.028595552,0.072039045,-0.018585632,0.018782618,0.10336785,-0.025184639,0.037141986,0.08182576,-0.043492295,-0.025188353,-0.056604903,-0.051839974,0.021248331,0.017352173,-0.011038268,-0.010597858,-0.08363814,0.019802343,0.0055567035,-0.06871979,0.022864822,-0.014080264,-0.012361201,-0.0070292093,0.0324753,-0.110912606,-0.047509972,0.011412872,0.012817721,0.038286783,-0.02934941,0.001286296,-0.014059427,0.017138755,0.06224984,-0.0047179083,0.11308716,-0.10559365,0.045894876,0.01474261,0.0077122706,0.08345392,0.035854768,-0.06855375,0.03723777,0.008835292,-0.10925217,-0.079873785,-0.07598289,-0.024733601,-0.047910508,-0.009919453,0.04983848,-0.03190207,0.0069295857,0.018676141,0.011002142,-0.046974547,0.031285986,-0.09512303,-0.100744404,6,-1.392957,21.634754,0
95,"sir started with discussion of midsem question paper. solution of midsem problem: 1. perform exploratory data analysis: we need to find problems with data set. find missing values in the dataset. we can drop rows with missing values if there are very less such rows and we have more data. or we can replace the missing values with mean or median based on distribution of data. understand the distribution of data within the columns and understand the distribution across the columns. normalise the data as required. if we have categorical data we can plot a histogram or pie chart. if there are very less data points of a particular category, just create a model that cannot detect that particular category. it is better not predict such categories with very less points. we have advantage if we have independent columns. in exam, the validation dataset were derived from a different dataset. we need to fit random forest to this kind of data. then sir discussed about solution to both parts. then one of the teaching assistant gave presentation about e3 review. then sir explained about curse of dimensionality. it describes the problems that occur when the number of features(dimensions) in a dataset increases significantly. we can address this by dimensionality reduction, feature selection, regularisation, increase in the amount of data.

105,"we thoroughly discussed the midsem exam in today's lecture. it started with possible ways of gaining insights from the data like kde plots, checking the range of values in each column, filling in the missing values, box plots for detecting outliers etc. while checking the range of values, we came to know that there is a need for normalisation of data. also we generated box plots to know the number of rows of each ailment in the data. from this, a student also suggested to oversample the data for heart diseases as the no of heart diseases detected were very less. but as they were very less as compared to the other ailments, we did not use this. from the co relation heat map, there wasn't any linear dependency between the 24 columns but as discussed by the professor we cannot trust this every time. for this problem, we need to find the variance inflation factor and do an iterative process from which we came to know that only six columns are really independent and others can be written as a linear combination of these six. then some discussions on the confusion matrix and performance metrics were also done. towards the end, assessment of e3 was discussed by one of the ta and we concluded our lecture by having a small chat about curse of dimensionality that how sparsity increases with increasing dimensions and to overcome this we can have more data or reduce the dimensions of the

119,"today's lecture did not cover any significant new topics. most of our lecture revolved around the midsem problem discussion where we had an overview of the solution in step by step manner. we then were joined by tas which gave review on the e3 exercise. we then started a new topic about the curse of dimensionality. this arises when there are too less data chasing too many features. the consequences of these are overfitting, increased sparsity, increased complexity, increased computational cost and distance distortion. we then had a discussion on the heat map which we created in midsem we did not show any correlation between any variables, which was very deceptive as some variables were multicollinear. we dealt with it by measuring r square between all xi and xj where iâ‰ j in a manner such that it checks the linear combinations for all possible patterns. we then concluded our lecture with a brief discussion on vif.

149,"with a focus on data analysis techniques, this session begun by reviewing key points from the midsem exam. we covered topics such as density estimation through kde graphs, validating data ranges, addressing absent values, and utilizing box diagrams to detect anomalies which was to be done in the exam. data normalization needs were identified, and though the concept of oversampling cases of heart disease was considered, the extreme class imbalance foreclosed the possibility.  due to multicollinearity i.e a statistical concept where several independent variables in a model are correlated the variables were correlated just not visible to be. we computed r2 statistics between pairs of features and employed the variance inflation factor to resolve this. what we found was that only 6 features were in effect independent, with all the other features being linear combinations of these.
we spoke about several performance evaluation methods, such as the confusion matrix.  the curse of dimensionality is a phenomenon that occurs when analyzing data in high-dimensional spaces. it can impact the accuracy of models, the speed of algorithms, and the ability to distinguish between data points which was also talked about in the class.  increasing the dataset or using dimensionality reduction techniques to maximize feature selection are two potential solutions to this problem.

219,"today's class was spent on revisiting the midsem exam in which we saw data insight analysis using kde plots, range checks, missing value imputation, and box plots for outliers. we determined that normalization was needed and touched upon a recommendation to oversample heart disease, which was not carried out as there was extreme class imbalance.
we went back to the midsem correlation heat map, which at first glance seemed to have no significant relationships. but this was deceptive because of multicollinearity. to correct for this, we calculated râ² values between all pairs of features and applied variance inflation factor (vif) to conclude that only six features were actually independent, and others could be represented as linear combinations of these.
the lecture also touched on performance measures, the confusion matrix, and ta feedback on the e3 exercise. we wrapped up with a discussion of the curse of dimensionality, which occurs when there are too many features compared to available data, causing overfitting, sparsity growth, computational expense, and complexity. the solutions are either to grow data volume or to shrink feature

223,"mostly we discussed midsem. we discussed different appraoches to the questions. we saw we can do eda and predicting ailment and in the next part we also saw what can be the reason. the main is different distirbution as kde plots were different. also we saw whether to impute the data or remove the rows as number of missing values were very small if compared to the data. we discussed different aspects of midsem question in detail and we understood that the data need to be well understandable to solve. we also started next topic : curse of dimensionality and about dimensionality reduction . feature selection ,increasing data or dropping features are some ways to reduce dimensions.also we saw variance equation factor which helps in seeing essential independent features.

241,"in the starting, we gave a look at both parts of the problem statement and understood that chatgpt is good for the coding part but not for designing the solution. we started off with the eda and made scatter plots and histograms. by looking into it, we realized the need for normalisation. then to check outliers, we made boxplots. it was very surprising to see that there were no outliers in any boxplot. to understand the representation of each ailment, we made a bar graph or pie chart. we came to know that heart diseases are very under-represented. as a result, we can say that we can't give our analysis on heart diseases because undersampling leads to loss of information while oversampling will not be accurate, so it is better to drop heart disease ailment.
we then made a heatmap to understand the correlations between parameters. we used random forest model for regression. by looking into the confusion matrix, we saw it gave a nice result except for heart disease.
we then made kde plots instead of histograms.
then we had a look at the curse of dimensionality. it leads to increased complexity and cost of computation. we can reduce it by reducing dimensions, feature selections, increasing the amount of data, etc.",-0.024680572,0.016447952,0.073180325,0.061121847,0.02789439,-0.07592162,-0.019822953,0.081788465,0.034864992,0.035821933,-0.035186667,0.020369262,-0.051557794,0.009732892,0.012223906,-0.028246231,0.043361027,-0.09109697,-0.098261416,-0.004559458,-0.011714725,0.04218518,-0.019029709,-0.0014679385,-0.04931527,-0.031350482,0.012517371,-0.089047834,-0.05056231,0.03821875,0.08111383,0.05999046,0.07721793,0.018626332,-0.121730596,-0.0049973805,0.043288905,0.08706862,-0.08276928,0.04585865,-0.03885129,-0.027423648,0.019434264,0.033267643,0.059758067,-0.057632327,-0.1644471,-0.039810672,0.0019639195,0.0047464976,-0.110805735,0.019478614,-0.02633913,0.0042003193,0.022197612,-0.055703748,-0.116455324,-0.07727094,-0.035195477,-0.07528609,0.03945,-0.0045553953,-0.020769445,-0.04358228,0.06806006,-0.034120757,0.05763593,0.0283125,0.0415191,0.0923782,0.040843498,0.019956926,-0.05664783,0.06635125,0.03908747,0.042613402,-0.032346524,-0.027989384,0.039330564,-0.049039192,0.08707632,0.07271003,0.033849657,0.034544583,0.01699233,-0.008516819,-0.039208617,0.018190436,-0.04950767,-0.020505555,0.03595534,-0.008930896,0.011634995,0.082393266,0.08967034,0.03637485,0.03489903,0.004874287,0.054217506,0.032264803,-0.027584871,-0.019638203,-0.06319911,-0.059446972,0.016551591,-0.03635566,0.07443823,-0.02438903,0.034629527,0.016818019,-0.0129142115,0.0076479646,0.016236719,0.0345818,0.069004826,-0.009424577,0.012299551,0.004276478,-0.042654242,0.09239799,0.033049103,-0.06394284,0.00082324474,0.05010476,-0.0028263764,0.07370885,-0.09322195,5.1097917e-33,0.06260807,0.0028936323,0.0053872853,0.013403906,0.039810862,-0.008643201,-0.104223624,-0.0939833,0.071188435,0.049088705,-0.022898741,0.012371442,0.04330259,0.04361558,0.0045521823,-0.014359057,-0.055762783,0.053811673,-0.028130546,-0.033880007,-0.047478516,-0.099303,0.015804734,0.0037274475,-0.026257094,0.08450124,0.018181855,-0.047515333,0.04421377,0.0013847341,-0.0057120994,-0.013369259,-0.046936937,-0.025118008,0.004084852,-0.035772953,0.034220316,-0.01423358,-0.03261247,0.05419314,-0.0065518273,-0.0005776399,0.022340626,-0.013217148,0.09455925,0.040570926,-0.0044097574,-0.04884643,-0.09715456,-0.005719798,-0.048161823,0.008822013,0.02331831,0.031067505,0.0042235428,0.010276896,-0.010626299,-0.04526986,0.004811027,0.08317569,3.1891792e-05,-0.054360654,0.020395592,-0.038847156,-0.0020441285,-0.021627901,-0.029243251,-0.08374076,-0.059860036,0.031122362,0.02501138,0.026389534,-0.07286394,-0.026312832,-0.027907064,0.025964882,0.019676225,0.13318913,-0.06762735,-0.049812317,-0.09518817,0.040041838,0.035078224,-0.038434044,-0.043337945,-0.13002463,0.025857098,0.021903178,-0.0838447,0.030833943,-0.10711888,0.09153052,-0.031183533,0.009978227,0.03597996,-4.3346354e-33,-0.09259652,0.099482454,-0.007565761,-0.0008915113,0.046381168,-0.0037594396,0.028954182,-0.02130326,0.11222944,-0.00947474,0.0059131607,-0.06919363,0.0065559526,0.0015896198,0.078517295,0.012729623,0.0061863456,-0.03663821,-0.051905997,0.015559876,-0.007062617,0.07267298,-0.102373116,0.00960556,-0.04675903,0.1025739,-0.13441886,-0.029575136,-0.098700754,-0.09280537,0.0050041536,0.008586587,-0.08418226,-0.05142932,-0.02969544,0.070440084,0.051532887,0.001519534,-0.05185958,-0.07269854,0.048001718,0.066451706,-0.08377485,-0.04713851,0.015101796,0.024841454,0.000783183,0.0034992327,0.0412089,0.05635435,0.065775916,-0.017299801,0.05604086,0.034419004,0.009749567,-0.012533387,0.03402728,0.011266403,-0.07378242,0.04257705,-0.014268676,-0.041086104,0.0070080888,-0.012070584,-0.033406205,-0.038040817,0.08819778,-0.014140329,0.07556947,-0.027288895,-0.009941832,-0.024517557,-0.059121024,0.0057651666,0.039695006,0.03368738,-0.040365107,0.0021354733,-0.022719484,-0.0014074093,-0.036390748,-0.07215261,0.098994754,0.019406935,-0.029900946,0.04818894,0.06857438,-0.05811338,0.009841447,0.042943772,-0.07046339,-0.035362504,-0.06559185,0.05427924,0.057067536,-6.2274964e-08,0.002464349,-0.07817239,-0.02331821,-0.02528033,-0.02177364,-0.051336236,-0.0665285,0.16977881,-0.021616211,0.059799485,0.070397906,-0.0069401865,-0.05565089,-0.012265399,0.06869113,-0.055720374,-0.035267703,0.07439704,-0.03477987,0.01340804,0.07115563,0.014550532,-0.031993117,0.042053185,0.049895108,-0.035626154,0.028116168,0.003980271,0.013982996,0.022294264,-0.029989414,0.002407576,0.055367794,0.12114465,0.04302477,-0.09664228,0.04096714,-0.042672977,-0.06586139,0.048641533,0.042280454,0.055010572,-0.032145962,-0.036414742,0.06321235,-0.07425197,0.019865815,0.02679681,0.044782408,-0.034922343,-0.037447877,0.012430755,0.05807351,-0.019887501,0.02952206,0.010977207,-0.033889275,0.0572448,-0.0027691687,0.034116518,0.018974917,0.05027322,-0.07822638,0.0081544,14,5.8042145,21.010283,0
273,"the class started off by discussing the midsemester examination. we realised that ai tools do provide the right guidance, but if asked for complete solutions, they do suggest something completely off. we discussed that the test data for the prediction model had a completely different distribution as compared to the training data. we also had very few samples for one class which made our model unreliable for predicting that class. we concluded that the understanding of the data is very important for us to make efficient use of ai tools. we then moved forward and discussed about the class performance in assignment e3, and filled a survey about the midsem exam experience. 
till now, we had discussed problems within the same column. now we move on to problems across columns. we started discussion about a concept known as the curse of dimensionality. it describes the problems which occurs when the number of features in the dataset increases significantly. in that case, we get increased sparcity, increased complexity, increased computational cost and distance distortions. if data becomes sparse in an n dimensional space, the distance between the points increases a lot, and hence pattern detection in daya becomes difficult. to deal with this issue, we should try to decrease the dimensionality, or maybe we should select the most relevant features or use regularisation. we discussed about variance inflation factor, where a feature x_i is tried to be expressed as a function of the other features x_j (j not equal to i) and then the r^2 value of this model, is used to calculate the vif for a given feature. vif is given by 1 / (1 - r^2), which tells us that as the value of r^2 for a given feature expression increases, the vif also increases. we then say that if the vif for a given feature exceeds 10, the feature can be expressed as a linear combination of other features, and hence that feature is eliminated. this procedure is done for all such features which have larger vifs. one feature having a large vif is removed and then the procedure is re-run. on doing this repeatedly, we tend to reduce the dimension and also filter out the most independent features.

303,"today's session covered variance inflation factor (vif) and the curse of dimensionality in machine learning. vif helps detect multicollinearity in regression models, where a high value indicates strong correlation between features, potentially affecting model stability. the curse of dimensionality describes challenges in high-dimensional data, such as increased sparsity, higher model complexity, computational costs, and distorted distance metrics, making pattern recognition harder. these concepts emphasize the need for careful feature selection and dimensionality reduction to improve model performance.

354,"in today's class, we discuss midsem problem and focused on exploratory data analysis (eda) and feature selection techniques. we began by identifying and handling missing values in the dataset. next, we discussed whether to standardize or normalize the data before proceeding with outlier detection using box plots. for categorical data, we visualized distributions using pie charts and observed that in a heart disease dataset, the disease was underrepresented, making it difficult for a model to predict it accurately. moving forward, we explored correlation analysis and its limitations, emphasizing that correlation only shows pairwise relationships and can be misleading. to address multicollinearity, we introduced the variance inflation factor (vif), which compares one column with all others and helps in selecting the most relevant features. we briefly discussed the random forest algorithm and reviewed the e3 assignment. later, we delved into the challenges posed by high-dimensional data, where too many features per observation can lead to inefficiencies. possible solutions include dimensionality reduction techniques like pca, feature selection, or collecting

obtain a set of variables with an acceptable

355,"in today's class we discussed the midsem paper and e3 assignment that was given before. apart from that we discussed about the curse of dimensionality and variance inflation factor (vif) in machine learning.

curse of dimensionality: as the number of features in a dataset increases, data points become more spread out, making pattern recognition harder. this also leads to more complex models, higher computational costs, and difficulty in measuring distances between points.

variance inflation factor (vif): we discussed how vif helps detect multicollinearity, which occurs when features in a dataset are highly correlated. high multicollinearity can make a model unstable and reduce its reliability.

371,"we started our lecture by revisiting the goals in exploratory data analysis which were getting insights, observing anomalies, testing hypothesis and checking assumptions. we then moved moved to a dataset having 500 summaries of our own course obtained over the past lectures. we analysed the data by observing things like number of words/characters per submission. each submission had nearly 1200 words on average but there were some outliers reaching upto 6000 words. we had a breif look on how to use pitot tables and its uses. we then looked on a real word problem which was based on optimisation in chemical plant. there were nearly 250 parameters to analyse. we used multiple plots to get an overview of the data. we also saw a histogram which was following normal distribution but there some points at 0 (outliers). it may be attributed to sensor failure but we cannot directly discard this outliers keeping in mind the nvidia stock example. thus domain knowledge is very important

387,"today's class, midsem paper was discussed. the following are the key take aways that i got:
1. in the case of multivariable dataset, checking for correlation between only two variables alone is not sufficient. one must look for any correlation between a variable and the linear combination of the rest as well. thus one fits a linear regression between them, gets the r^2 value and finds a metric called variance inflation factor. we can set a threshold for this metric(say around 8). one can conclude that the variable has a strong correlation with the linear combination of other variables. thus one may consider excluding that variable from the dataset. as one keeps doing this one by one, until only those variables with vif less than a threshold are present, one can reduce the number of independent variables in our dataset.
2. every step of data-analysis must be supported then and there by clear thinking and reasoning. one must be able to justify all the assumptions and steps in their workflow.
3. learnt that in cases where a class is under-represented in the training dataset, if the difference between the support of that class and an another is very huge, it is ok to drop the class for model creation. undersampling majority class means, one is giving too few samples to the model=> weak training, oversampling minority ones also won't make up meaningful data.
4. the concept of dimensionality reduction: some datasets have large number of variables. this has certain disadvantages. more variables means, the complex will be the pattern between them. if as many data is not available to capture the complexity, the output of the training will not be appreciable. some of the solutions to handle this issue are dimensionality reduction, feature selection,

425,"eda's core purpose is to explore data to understand its structure, identify patterns and anomalies, and formulate hypotheses, ultimately preparing it for more rigorous analysis and modeling. we now analysed the summary dataset. qty of words or average length of each entry was close to 1200 words, although some submissions were as long as 6000 .after that, we examined a real-world situation that involved chemical plant optimization.we looked at several graphs/charts to get an overview of data.we observed a histogram with some points at 0 but mostly following a normal distribution. given the example of the nvidia stock, we cannot simply rule out this outlier, even though it might be the result of sensor failure.pitot tables were analysed. prior to rejecting these ideals, domain understanding is crucial and necessitates cross-questioning with stakeholders.in order to prepare for more precise analysis, we tackled data challenges such as skewed categories and underlined the significance of data refinement using methods like feature engineering.e2 feedback was given at the

427,"we discussed steps of solution for the midsem test. 1) eda- firstly intra column issues and representation, then inter stats using heat maps.  2) predictive model: random forest are good. confusion matrix, metrics should be done. do for validation data as well. 3) analysis: distribution very different among the datasets


some points discussed: 1)as heart disease data not much and difference is too high among the columns so under-over sampling should not be done, it will reduce data spread so better to say heart disease will not be predicted that good. 2)got to know an interesting fact, even if heat map shows no correlation, we can still have multi collinearity.
we started curse of dimensionality. sparse data,  distance in n dimensional space how to segregate.

431,"today's class began with the discussion of midsem problem which was followed by e3 discussion. problems which arise due to high dimensional data were discussed. significance of distance between data points decreases in higher dimensions. it becomes difficult to distinguish between nearest and farthest points. complexity of the model increases . data becomes more sparse i.e more spread out .

473,"sir discussed the mid sem paper and i realised that i have done many mistakes. the main thing was i didnt understand the question properly 2nd i wasted too much time on writing code manually i could have used chat gpt for it. sir had written functions for cleaning the data and imputing it with the mean value of the columns and the missing data rows were only 4 so it would have not mattered if had dropped them. then we looked into the visualisation part of it we plotted box plots to check for outliers then made histograms to know the distribution of the different columns , and made kde plots for both the intial and validation data sets to know the differences. trained random forest classifier on the train and test data and then compared the metrics by running the model on the validation data set to find out that it performs poorly indicating that the sample is not from pune and this could also been concluded from the kde plots. plotted the bar plots of ailments and got to know that heart disease is the least in number and this will no have good results in the classifier and thus we tell that our model is not going to predict the heart disease and reliably and move forward. we saw the heat map of corelation coefficient and saw no corelation among the columns but this was linear corelation but there might be non-linear corelation and thus we were introduced to multi variate analysis where we fix a model for xi with all other xj where j not equal to 1 find there r^2 value amd find 1/(1-r^2) to find out the corelation if its high then we drop the

496,in today's class first we discuss the solution for the midsem examination. after that one of the ta gave us some comments about our e3 assignment. and after that we learnt about the codes of dimensionality which says that two less data chasing too many features. it is basically a challenge for machine learning which arises when we deal with data in high dimensional spaces it describes the problems that occur when the number of features or dimensions in datasets increase significantly. as the number of dimension increases the available data points becomes increasingly spread out or sparse in the high dimensional space which makes it harder to find meaningful patterns and relationships. can we learnt about how to address this curse like you can use dimensionality reduction for feature selection or regularisation or we can increase the number of data. and then we learnt that if y is a function of different kinds of x then whether xi is dependent on some other x i not = j . we can find this with the help of creating regression models between xi and all other xs. we can also use this variance inflation factor and once we found the value we can start eliminating the ones with larger variance inflation factors one by

518,"in today's class, we mainly discussed our mid-semester test. we first analyzed the data, which has 24 columns of blood parameters, 1 ailment column, and 2371 rows, providing information about the population residing in an area. based on blood samples taken, we identified whether they are healthy or have certain types of disease. we gave an open test so that we can use tools, but do not rely on them so much that they will solve the problem effectively like an expert. in the test, we can get solutions through multiple paths, we need to take one and justify it. based on the nature of the data, define what kind of problem you are going to solve. in the test, a simple classification model was needed, and we also needed to create a model and state why it is not working on the validation dataset. also, as per vp's choice, we should have made kde, not histogram. heading towards the solution, we must report missing values, either not consider them in model training or replace them with some values. for this, we need to know about the trend/distribution of the data, for this we can plot a scatter plot of all the columns, which shows the data was all over the plot, as there was no time series in the question, and hence randomness was there in the data. the histogram should be normal. we can use the mean to fix the missing values in certain cases only, but not always. then we need to consider the range of values across the columns, do we need to normalize or standardize the data, for this we plotted the histogram of all the blood parameters, in them some were unimodal, some were bimodal, and not normal and hence we do not get anything from these but these will be helpful when comparing with new dataset. we then see the descriptive statistics for the parameters and also compare with the validation data statistics and plots. at the minimum, we should get the data normalized between 0 and 1, hence we should have applied normalization on the datasets at least. we also see the box plot of numerical data, in which we see one column that was higher than others, hence the need for normalization is there. we also get to know about outliers through the columns and saw that there were no outliers in the columns. then we analyzed the ailment column using a bar chart, which can be made through a pivot table or counting in excel, and also through python. the heart disease population was much less compared to others, and thrombocytosis was also less than another disease in the initial dataset. hence, the model will not identify heart disease effectively and needs more data of these in the dataset for a better model. we plotted a simple correlation heatmap, which tells us that the columns are not correlated much and is good for us. we also discussed that tree-based models are good for modelling such kinds of data. then we split the dataset into test and train data (20% and 80%). we applied the random forest model on the data, and we saw that there was no misclassification for other diseases except heart diseases. then we looked at the confusion matrix of the validation data, which was not very good compared to the original dataset given. then we perform the distribution analysis to see why the model performed badly on the validation dataset. in that, we compare the plots of the original and validation dataset, which majorly shows the distributions are different for the datasets, which at last states that the data are from different populations and training the model on one will not perform well on the other. then we get the

we started analyzing all the expectations that had to be carried out for midsem solutions.
it basically included performing eda (missing vales replaced with means, scatter plots to understand the nature of variables, watch out for the description of the data) we foundd that normalization was required to do so. next, computing outliers using box plots. also analyzing ailments to understand bars of diseases, where it was seen to drop the heart disease in the model. 
next there was discussion on exercise e3
in the later part we started with the curse of dimensionality to answer questions such as what will happen if features>>datapoints or features<<datapoints. increased sparsity, computational complexity and overfitting were some general issues. than we entered into collinearity and multi-collinearity ending with the variance inflation pattern

526,"at the start of class, sir discussed the midsem question paper. sir explained the question paper and shared the approach of solving the question and problems associated with it. 
first step is exploratory data analysis. we first try to find the missing values in the data. there were four rows with missing values. one way to solve this is to drop the four rows. we can justify it because we have 2371 rows. another way to solve it is to fill in the missing values. plotting the parameters, we noticed that there is randomness in the data. the histogram would show a normal distribution. this suggests that even if we replace the missing data with the mean it would be ok. before filling the value, we check the range of value of parameters to check if we need to do standardization or normalization. we find that for some parameters the range is very small while for some the range is really high. we still don't have visualization for outliers. for this we use the box-plots. we first use box plot on all the columns to check if any column is different. then we check for individual outliers (surprisingly there are no outliers). for the column with ailments, we use a bar-chart or pie-chart. we notice that heart-diseases is under-represented. one way is oversampling or under sampling. as the difference is very large for the under sampled data, we can conclude that the model would not be able to heart-disease properly. 
heatmap is the first step in finding the correlation between the columns. we notice that there is no correlation between the columns. the point is that doing pair-wise correlation is suicidal. we need additional steps to decide if there is any correlation between columns. the problem here is of multi-collinearity. we can use variance inflation factor analysis. 

when we have two entirely different samples, we try going for kde plots. after creating the kde plots, we notice that the distribution of each column is different for both the samples. this suggests that the model fitted on one sample cannot be used on the other sample. this means that both the samples come from different populations. 

by the end of the class we started with a new topic: the curse of dimensionality. too less data chasing too much features. we don't have enough data for representation of the columns. this is a problem when dealing with high dimensional data. this problem increases sparsity. this results in loss in the discriminative power of the model. the consequences are: overfitting (model stick to the given data and are not much reliable). for this we can try to reduce the number of features. we can do feature selection, regularization or increase the amount of data. these solutions are easier said than done. we checked for variance inflation factor. if a feature has a vif more than 10, then it can be expressed as a linear combination of other features. we can hence eliminate the features with vif greater than 10.

537,"in todayâ€™s class we spent our major time on discussing mid sem paper. we discussed about methods and procedures to be followed to solve the problems. the first step would be exploring dataset like the number of columns and rows, any missing values present or not. the second step would be data preprocessing steps like handling missing values, checking the descriptive statistics of dataset. if the data is random then replace missing values with statistics value. to find any outliers present in the dataset, we should create the box plot of each column. we would also see the distribution of â€œailmentsâ€ columns by creating bar chart, pie chart or any other plot. by creating this we would see that heart disease comes in very small count as compared to any other ailments. the best way to handle these problems is by looking manually on this. the scatter plot of columns should be created to see that the distribution is random or not. another plot we created is the heatmap which shows that columns are not correlated, but it is not sufficient. as there is correlation between some columns which can be checked by the variance inflation factor. for validation dataset, kde plot shows that the data is very different from that of training data.
the new topic we learned is curse of dimensionality â€”
it describes the problems that occur when the number of features in a dataset increases significantly. it arises when dealing with data in high-dimensional space. we can address this curse by
1. dimensionality reduction
2. increase the number of data points

546,"class started with sir giving us a solution to the modem question explaining every step of the open ended question. here in question two the fresh dataset given was from a totally different population this was to be determined via plotting smooth curves which substitute histograms. then sir solved the problem himself starting with eda by checking missing values and dropping the rows with missing values. plotting the scatter plots for each columns suggest no specific trend in the data which suggests that the missing values can be filled with average values of the columns. then we checked the range of data the range varied drastically which suggested the need for normalisation. then we moved on to check for outliers by plotting box plots. a boxplot of all the columns suggested that there was a need for normalisation again as one of the columns were drastically different than others. the individual box plots suggested that there were no outliers. now the bar plots suggested that class heart diseases was under represented now the solution for this to drop the prediction of heart diseases due to under representation of heart diseases in the dataset here artificial data generation or under sampling are not feasible due to the huge difference in number of values of different classes relavtive to each other. next we generate inter correlation heatmap which concluded that the variables are not correlated to each other but a definitive test is needed to confirm this. further sir used random forest and gbm to fit the data. here the model predicted the second dataset poorly to justify this distributions of both the sample datasets were compared which suggested that they were from different. now sir emphasized the need for fundamentals. later e3 was reviewed by one of the teaching assistants and sir took review for the midsem test. later sir moved on to teach us about across the column problems starting with the curse of dimensionality which leads to overfitting, increased computation, etc these can be solved via dimensionality reduction done via feature selection and also regularisation to tune models to prevent over fitting. here the amount of data can also be increased. now to check interdependence of xi on xj, linear regression is done for each xi and r^2 is determined and variance inflation factors are calculated. now features with large vif are removed until the remaining features show a vif of less than 10.

617,"we started off with discussion the right way to go about our midterm. so we basically had to go through eda and then comment on it by using a classifier model. major pointss are, looking for missing values, and decided whether to drop them or fill them. if we fill them what logic should be used. next we saw how one of the labels was very, very low, so then to represent it we either ask for more genuine data or let it be and get some wrong results. making copies is not the way around here. next was to find outliers, lucky our data didn't have any.  next was to see what happens when we fit it in a model. the the validation data part, we were to figure out why the model will predict bad here. so we can look at the features and compare them and it was inferred that the data was mostly from different samples.
next we had a small review of e3.
then we talked about the dilemma of dimensionality. more dimensions mean more information, but also more computation time and cost, more data to look after and all. so to deal with this we they to make features as a function of other features. and to look at this we use a metric, variance inflation

618,"in this class, we mainly discussed the midsem paper. sir showed us how we could have attempted the questions. the first part involved performing eda on the given data set to find out the missing values and outliers. the early exploratory stage involves creating scatter plots and histograms of distribution of the parameters to understand how they are distributed. next, to handle the missing values, we can either drop them completely or we can approximate them to some value. it depends on the trend in the data (which can be seen through the scatter plots), whether to use simple mean or some moving average. in this case, the data was randomly spread in the entire region, hence we could use the mean value of each column to fill the missing values. 
there can be mainly two types of problems- problem within the column, which involves missing values and the problem across the columns, which involves significant differences in the values of the parameters in the two columns. in such a normalization is required, to ensure that a particular class is not under-expressed/ suppressed by the others.
box plots give us idea about the outliers. in this case, there werenâ€™t any outliers.
we can visualize the categorical data using bar charts/ pie charts.
 correlation heat maps can also be used to check for the relations between the different parameters. the problem with this is that it only checks for the correlation between a feature and only one other feature at a time. however, it is possible that a feature depends on multiple other features and is a linear combination of those. correlation maps do not provide this information. hence, they are sufficient but not necessary check of correlation.
for solving this problem, we use â€˜variance inflation factorâ€™(vif). it compares each feature with all other features taken together. to find out the vif, we express each feature as a linear combination of the others and fit a regression model on it. we then find the r2 values for each of the feature. vif is then calculated as 1/(1-r2). so, as r2 increases, vif also increases. hence, if r2 values is high, it indicates strong correlation among the features.
if vif of a feature is >10 then that feature can be expressed as a linear combination of the others, hence we remove that feature column from our data.
in this way, we reduce the dimensionality of the data set, as high dimensionality is a curse. it spreads out the data more, thereby making it difficult to find out important patterns from the data.
the next part in the question was to check whether the derived regression model worked well for another different data set as well. by plotting kde plots and analyzing the descriptive statistics of the new data set, we observed that it had completely different distribution than the original data set, which suggested that it belonged to a completely different population. this was also evident by the looking at the values of accuracy, precision, recall and f1 scores of the model, fitted to the new data. hence, the original model did not work well for the new data, which belonged to a different population.

632,"midsem discussion:
we discussed about the questions that came up in midsems. the first question was all about exploratory data analysis (eda), we donâ€™t have to create an entire model as such, but we needed to analyze all the data that was given to understand what itâ€™s all about. stuff like, how many rows, how many columns, basics. and then we moved on to missing rows, in this case, since the number is very small, we could drop those rows. else, we could replace those with the mean of the data. this can only be done when data has no particular trend, and it has missing values. we observed a scatter plot to see that. then we saw the histogram as per each column. some are bimodal, some are unimodal, but those didnâ€™t give many insights. then we plotted a pie chart. also, we saw the heat correlation map, it shows a very ideal case, no correlation between the columns so we donâ€™t have to drop anything. however, this analysis is necessary, but not sufficient to say that the columns are not related. sometimes there might be a more serious problem of multi collinearity. 
for the second part of the question we learnt that the main reason why the model created wasnâ€™t working for the new data, was because it was for a different population. performing descriptive statistics on both the data side by side revealed this to us.
important points learnt:
â€¢	on any raw data, perform eda to get a complete understanding of data. 
â€¢	if the data is random, if there is no particular trend, only then you can replace the missing values with mean of the data. 
â€¢	if heat correlation map indicates correlation, it has correlation. but if it doesnâ€™t, then thatâ€™s not a good enough conclusion to say that the columns are not related. sometimes there might be a more serious problem of multi collinearity. so itâ€™s necessary, but not sufficient.

657,"in today's lecture, sir explained how we were supposed to approach midsem problem. we were required to essentially perform eda and then try to fit a classification model (note clustering was not required at all). in order to perform eda, we had first find missing value and then drop or replace it(dropping values was not a big deal as only 4 rows had missing values in 2000+ rows). we then had to plot box plot to detect outliers but there was no outlier. check if there was a need to normalise the data by checking the range of parameters.(large difference in range proposes a need for normalisation), plot scatter plots and histogram, and state descriptive statistics, generate heatmap of all the parameters (there was not much linear correlation between them, but there was possibility of multi-collinearity) count the number of cases of each ailment (heart diseasewas under represented); after all this, fitting a random forest classification model was required. then we had to plot kde plots for both the data set (q1 and q2) to see whether the distribution is same in both cases or not. the kde plots were not same and classification was not predicting the disease properly which suggests that the dataset were essentially of two different populations.
then the tas discussed e3 evaluation with us. at last, sir gave an introduction and explained 
 about the topic the curse of dimensionality. what are the reasons for its occurance and how to tackle it? dropping features, features selection, dimensionality reduction, regularisation, etc.",0.0123882545,-0.03232358,0.07578802,0.06025635,0.08026117,-0.06493732,-0.09565522,0.025224686,-0.039731354,0.050665002,0.00426295,-0.014978986,0.022146486,-0.048916098,-0.0020537134,-0.0064599887,0.033156782,-0.09421961,-0.098111644,-0.04123689,-0.0026592994,0.045285255,-0.090803705,0.022421625,-0.01244103,-0.013094466,0.056227833,0.015420904,-0.037386615,0.024965463,0.090827644,-0.0035531064,0.028154157,0.04514273,-0.08622219,-0.010417722,0.051582135,0.011237871,-0.034793872,0.012822173,0.017068494,0.008028697,-0.0072099613,0.009952885,0.028038513,-0.0062707774,-0.0985261,-0.06282533,-0.040463142,-0.047820292,-0.032057617,0.00033443733,-0.09154387,0.034046646,-0.005741113,-0.0160509,-0.005044559,-0.11614436,0.008620139,-0.06109077,-0.01101889,-0.020638581,-0.010440879,0.003046035,0.09612829,-0.00085511006,0.09205398,0.028043292,0.08863395,0.03685339,0.03393967,0.008161206,-0.018152853,0.039149873,0.014863224,-0.017701698,-0.03234533,0.070779435,0.013599295,-0.124600306,0.029109234,0.07924111,0.002772059,0.020816674,0.058842923,0.03975015,-0.05736886,-0.021126846,-0.027444765,-0.0558052,0.106968395,0.045335364,-0.06080302,0.0036207454,0.047826406,0.047711898,0.06579555,0.010764722,0.08623735,0.06808239,-0.007145929,-0.011968849,-0.016374955,-0.013781918,-0.0075152176,-0.04482996,0.058644358,-0.00058935257,-0.0235242,0.022068419,0.016797028,-0.016337253,0.002443814,0.045906406,0.09828376,-0.04588809,0.06797962,-0.004518493,-0.06594352,0.012042161,-0.058773752,-0.030784685,0.018046465,0.087603375,0.020320596,0.07200553,-0.091898784,8.754594e-33,0.078587025,-0.057494257,-0.039599758,0.017672189,0.00017248883,-0.017096585,-0.07321821,-0.05669362,0.1153747,0.055365007,-0.03075676,0.103323825,0.06208799,-0.044864982,-0.024174,0.00042706163,0.00722815,0.017005185,-0.05828148,-0.0058103264,-0.045402877,-0.085146375,0.053939704,-0.03308587,-0.052675508,0.11324096,0.041366834,0.023779118,0.068559736,0.0014402942,-0.0085456455,0.007575392,-0.046489518,-0.013558244,-0.054764904,-0.042786237,0.03334141,0.0049263397,-0.006724334,-0.04139487,-0.023574563,0.015447001,0.052678753,-0.018878961,0.040194023,0.044343363,0.008981843,0.004725056,-0.023058463,-0.0031486466,-0.046784155,-0.050633226,0.039446283,-0.040134992,-0.07594799,0.07387309,0.08222836,-0.08103432,-0.032855205,0.05680899,0.013710769,-0.016761243,-0.025920786,0.0033769808,0.023066757,0.017726466,-0.05698849,-0.016247554,-0.025368858,0.033740923,0.014317615,0.0093523795,-0.04788718,0.05062834,0.045500807,-0.07960706,0.03709756,0.11249504,-0.07018213,-0.059310433,0.007190766,0.00692549,-0.023257235,-0.03501208,-0.0156308,-0.09726705,0.011150415,0.020974567,-0.10150016,0.019622618,-0.045427304,0.060155958,0.006059636,0.0641976,0.0515835,-7.913517e-33,-0.0582274,0.09482376,0.0042552697,0.1056856,0.03684999,0.05061201,-0.017908292,0.047695883,0.10424712,-0.0375171,0.00449648,-0.04255605,0.06650593,-0.012474054,0.04463138,0.006911613,0.029771408,-0.018999755,-0.009770815,0.011303708,0.06183052,0.05534761,-0.099019445,-0.03551548,-0.09487229,0.0529836,-0.105864055,0.0035313317,-0.11342194,-0.07939318,0.016966607,-0.048532575,-0.08622291,-0.04559654,-0.09763184,0.0035533323,0.013876545,-0.015091976,-0.083866626,-0.009102038,0.0019041467,0.08267186,-0.06816905,0.015651084,-0.009553156,0.07797391,0.04257536,0.033563197,0.036625985,0.010307487,0.004759648,-0.035516575,0.016676137,0.046483595,-0.013536188,0.023926193,0.00981006,0.0116388565,-0.09946466,0.021095116,-0.030355982,-0.026205719,0.0070851548,-0.04858851,-0.026202247,0.02155587,0.07787169,-0.0331401,0.0018386331,0.011680341,0.020530393,-0.0039289636,-0.028925264,-0.093848646,0.040603124,-0.004369463,-0.15105279,-0.07409213,-0.034216326,-0.019533569,-0.04948247,-0.08128134,0.025133599,0.0937808,-0.036239874,0.11724481,0.06075932,-0.10184964,0.045144647,-0.03145187,0.016424432,0.00199973,-0.033654895,0.08430057,0.016220495,-7.017678e-08,-0.065882675,-0.04290465,-0.061756242,-0.05208002,0.029753447,-0.066882275,-0.028768536,0.12034875,0.0043234946,0.018669555,0.05985794,-0.04543214,-0.093180336,0.0198081,0.07147714,-0.043354858,0.034766395,0.07377115,-0.047791943,0.054044653,0.0350129,-0.024538733,0.0034185124,0.028890805,0.11303058,-0.020111708,0.052775912,0.049167085,0.029052533,0.037198763,-0.042378,-0.05053395,0.02121661,0.07992922,-0.033710662,0.029034602,0.0310146,0.046996765,-0.047076732,0.0066222795,0.002089509,0.038517747,-0.043606997,0.036222145,0.038699977,0.008476631,-0.016497664,-0.005864562,0.06974985,-0.07376938,0.00021782811,-0.03353614,0.010336997,0.027532987,-0.058879323,-0.06550072,-0.021890989,-0.013518545,0.021992328,-0.0042111683,0.068298,-0.06623289,-0.13315,0.00782898,14,5.731727,21.971945,0
