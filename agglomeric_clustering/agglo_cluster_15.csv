18,firstly we started with a hands on excel session sir started with teaching us how to calculate beta0 and beta1 and eventually y_cap and error values. later sir questioned the class regarding the prediction of of data points beyond the regression line which is in turn unpredictable due to sample constraints. later sir emphasized regarding accessing the model by judging the noise and it's behavior which is supposed to be totally random for a good model. further we learnt the definition and characteristics of a histogram briefly and judging whether an error distribution is random or not. a random error distribution should follow a normal/gaussian distribution which is due to the error being dependent upon many-many unknown variables. further we understood the use of data analysis toolpack. further sir discussed the coefficient of determination. for the case of simple linear regression is exactly the same as the square of the correlation coefficient 'r' between x and y which doesn't hold true for multiple linear regression. the class ends with derivation of

26,"in today's session, we plotted x and y values for a given dataset and calculated a and b of the regression line using the x and y data, respectively, using ms excel. then, we plotted the histogram graph of the errors, i.e., actual values of y minus the predicted values of y. the height of the histogram represents the no. of values in the bin of a particular class width. using a histogram, we observed whether the data was uniform or random. we saw an example of a fitted line on non-linear data and the resulting scatter plot of the error values{ei} displaying a distinct pattern, stating the model has failed to pick up the inherent pattern in the data. using the data analysis tool pack in excel, we created a summary output of the given data showing various numbers like r-square, p-value, etc. a good model explains variations in the data. the measure of the total variation in the given dataset(sst) is equal to the sum of the total variation explained by the regression model(ssr) and the variation not explained by the model, attributed to random errors(sse) and one another term that gives zero on summing it up. dividing ssr with sst gives you the value of the coefficient of determination(r-square). for slr, c.o.d. is equal to the square of the correlation coefficient of r. a positive correlation in the data means the value of x increases, and the value of y also increases, while a negative correlation means if x increases then y decreases. if we take a population and calculate the means of different samples we have taken, the histogram of these means will follow a normal distribution. the standard error of the distribution is equal to the standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the size of the sample. a random sample with a finite mean and standard deviation will approach a normal distribution as the value of n becomes sufficiently large(central limit theorem).",-0.036310133,0.05696854,0.0023181704,0.01614226,0.022570262,0.023207292,-0.02641227,0.05457744,0.035675306,0.012798737,-0.0169838,-0.015051568,0.061836213,0.008963054,0.004132956,-0.0577004,0.016868811,-0.09223488,-0.037139345,-0.027487252,0.09118103,0.017896464,-0.09264194,0.029617228,0.07223803,0.015521739,0.01716775,0.02116595,-0.06796331,-0.027846316,0.018321978,0.038046833,-0.005890868,0.093068935,-0.00917748,-0.06568131,0.032564722,0.07677357,0.08506894,0.009223203,0.0032702032,0.02405003,0.053860165,0.10601265,0.012136405,-0.071003005,-0.06582813,-0.09833732,-0.046268158,0.030748269,0.022999726,0.016553938,0.040798083,-0.005704539,0.046102617,-0.018337077,0.033921074,-0.006146093,0.14087889,0.0011909838,0.044709392,0.018322052,0.009572667,0.028341604,0.060899038,0.02679153,-0.017420055,-0.027285552,0.05687202,0.07354965,-0.045627646,0.057198267,-0.020577032,0.042678565,-0.0091732,0.01788774,-0.09082337,0.0563165,-0.025607789,-0.04497746,-0.06346696,0.031005058,0.025607603,0.07103756,0.015429963,0.01954052,0.033052865,-0.012153735,0.045207396,0.04993795,-0.02713286,0.013987651,-0.10790251,0.06727076,-0.030770743,0.04348617,0.035233438,-0.026703727,0.08224883,0.012221912,0.024443187,0.052025747,0.0069894255,0.038436092,0.010781121,-0.03981764,0.047701307,-0.03540211,-0.0024772442,0.027526207,-0.020028435,-0.080507666,-0.084497266,0.0024736538,0.030717326,-0.022119446,-0.055276897,0.011488166,-0.14831027,0.047006167,0.01542417,0.011602379,0.023842992,0.058176123,-0.0031615982,-0.01094263,-0.11531379,1.0441317e-33,-0.0020803313,-0.08315012,-0.029786043,0.0031248096,0.026814144,-0.060583003,-0.13024873,-0.01728655,0.091479495,0.10041536,-0.046723563,0.051687807,0.046894897,0.03645814,0.029641315,0.06880435,-0.0138271125,-7.265738e-05,-0.06568827,0.038028933,-0.07416639,-0.06406814,0.07264245,-0.046551228,-0.012419287,0.03028648,-0.02497844,0.08237112,-0.02701275,0.030969597,0.005093914,0.04868161,0.09447243,-0.05609611,0.05629018,-0.08934918,0.037590407,0.026982578,0.010437722,0.06323118,0.049573585,0.0062513337,0.030069435,0.011070728,0.010977009,0.015254857,0.046304137,0.0155052245,0.02986813,0.043351762,-0.089429125,0.035987098,0.046020783,-0.0026625323,-0.06912239,0.057618268,0.037064776,-0.018236939,-0.028093,0.049681574,-0.014568346,0.02152394,-0.013905653,-0.04557815,0.011440313,0.03869427,-0.019479938,0.004338255,-0.057314534,-0.008466196,-0.02451051,0.016024593,0.01660125,0.036099084,0.070848085,-0.052489314,-0.011595847,0.11198256,-0.07652251,-0.084746286,0.024832545,-0.051496863,-0.012284783,-0.14037363,-0.107070774,-0.021149794,0.017387802,0.045950517,-0.06321509,-0.06714805,0.043006577,-0.019063443,-0.046682067,0.030344557,0.029055862,-2.9490505e-33,-0.0753927,0.13920535,0.00094528444,-0.0006141253,0.014678978,0.07562728,0.08475792,0.058636677,0.07027882,0.028224729,0.02797114,-0.01957245,-0.047555894,0.08008924,-0.005132018,0.039459415,-0.07340831,-0.07289021,-0.010513006,-0.04757428,0.051970027,-0.010828099,-0.02077865,-0.059140734,-0.02105512,0.08599363,-0.111442685,0.029441226,-0.075513355,-0.034973897,0.031602528,0.030608801,-0.03397811,-0.112871975,-0.03943607,0.010905923,0.026567476,-0.017423574,0.0131416675,-0.02310875,0.014390329,0.049609493,-0.016153239,-0.039813265,0.03032605,0.028664729,0.018328201,0.016715422,0.0741662,-0.022446863,-0.010379411,0.1169119,-0.006189186,0.046135787,0.015153761,0.013134114,-0.04488181,0.010823654,-0.10394385,0.018426782,-0.05737944,-0.06892566,-0.054690447,-0.03297444,-0.051233448,0.036554474,-0.0069845724,-0.11310989,0.06875364,0.023246897,0.049676668,-0.092515744,-0.015989276,-0.065796986,0.01894617,-0.0063436283,-0.05787982,-0.058841873,-0.05756541,0.08390979,0.023615746,-0.036267113,0.06152823,0.018584099,-0.008707849,0.0032526313,-0.09437184,0.02370143,-0.005517735,0.054548305,-0.021520872,0.0164928,-0.092570946,0.03771248,0.076068535,-6.217117e-08,-0.045186948,-0.082748525,0.036709577,-0.032748513,0.08792852,-0.010603249,-0.014514589,0.02386514,0.0169084,-0.011659204,0.026345395,-0.010938507,-0.15571727,-0.03914957,-0.0115591455,0.005934064,0.002656295,0.027464278,-0.015337589,-0.024938641,-0.03444623,-0.05580943,-0.05267507,-0.024207592,0.04714582,-0.03243605,-0.046100706,0.1253068,-0.066803806,0.02739976,0.039219517,-0.017922414,0.036340777,-0.038663723,-0.05623544,0.030430607,0.036901917,0.018722124,0.030104406,0.037732493,-0.017928725,-0.03891872,-0.014921504,0.027391177,0.08672842,0.057365384,0.008728756,-0.009819561,0.011786719,-0.13107483,0.006861062,-0.06515837,-0.092318244,0.036845326,-0.04371856,-0.052498017,-0.08027944,0.0069912076,-0.008240134,-0.010621917,0.011278521,-0.029144017,-0.045599937,-0.0940056,10,-22.871977,11.246005,15
61,"in today's lecture, we used excel to perform linear regression. we started by opening a csv file, extracting the necessary parameters, and creating a scatter plot with a fitted linear trendline. additionally, we plotted a histogram and a scatter plot of the error values, which showed a distinct pattern. these plots, along with other factors, can be analyzed to evaluate the quality of a model.",-0.01231151,7.415859e-05,-0.036983702,0.019513404,-0.01508602,0.046197493,-0.08737751,0.012015485,-0.016598724,0.033974946,-0.0036985907,0.03946631,0.06515852,-0.013528065,0.008224195,-0.015503458,-0.003055905,-0.0598863,0.014403799,-0.015869908,0.03286969,-0.026679115,-0.120330624,-0.03683511,0.0848013,0.0073456233,-0.00840889,-0.021666337,-0.06749921,-0.0010479499,-0.042427976,0.0052893218,0.06466417,0.07260329,-0.025735728,-0.072968535,0.049310077,0.042977337,0.048737537,0.040564176,-0.05200125,-0.014057947,0.08406935,0.040179927,0.07002806,-0.062322415,-0.031864516,-0.051234562,-0.015303825,0.039673727,-0.077532396,-0.032386523,0.07478576,-0.04337517,0.03888127,-0.035018764,-0.029998602,-0.041421104,0.13092242,-0.02508418,0.029740287,0.031864785,-0.017383128,0.056571998,0.030196954,0.044949405,-0.09714752,0.04733228,0.017689891,0.07004351,-0.1067315,0.009777766,-0.04134492,-0.003391688,-0.04098878,-0.008591314,-0.072876506,-0.05307693,-0.028148467,-0.038282968,0.0071029933,0.00019767144,-0.016602935,0.015976222,0.013981316,0.03378618,0.07166156,0.0028748433,-0.045955162,0.04001121,0.022727331,0.082549654,-0.057120103,0.0861464,-0.0920917,0.09439009,0.023792816,-0.082568765,0.07025576,0.023805542,0.018050283,0.014677162,0.025038319,-0.0049211774,-0.021641618,-0.007498558,0.068243116,0.031638656,0.007558996,-0.013243375,-0.062345996,-0.04440387,-0.1182832,-0.04126606,0.102191,-0.081152014,-0.013577615,-0.03350395,-0.050293263,-0.0131823225,0.05850612,0.012019006,0.009440854,0.037026543,0.012947955,0.010877975,-0.10137679,-8.217082e-34,-0.06418729,0.014435151,-0.03622605,0.01752354,0.007859425,-0.06669255,-0.069878004,-0.04267811,0.05514434,0.05714674,-0.043478478,0.030599704,-0.02537789,0.0767307,0.052393045,0.05235161,0.04370655,-0.01953492,-0.035691526,0.0758142,-0.08172571,-0.09943549,0.062227506,-0.030495718,0.03058192,0.02505707,0.048749957,0.07449245,-0.014825915,-0.010150022,0.085160136,0.050275784,-0.0049323756,-0.060468517,0.0040019727,-0.06374565,-0.01786392,0.05573607,0.08517639,0.027525509,-0.016694177,0.0127973305,0.016414136,0.025028367,0.06774746,0.11341517,0.020855248,0.044292215,0.06692705,-0.01664165,-0.0556983,-0.03063647,0.010118249,0.065656975,-0.07336859,0.09575291,-0.05352998,-0.044259895,-0.05320289,0.026701907,-0.0021245745,-0.0024628206,-0.017571595,-0.12294999,-0.048689254,0.010861085,0.02649841,0.031899832,-0.029854003,-0.008696127,-0.04787537,-0.0018467361,-0.025803424,-0.011485255,0.09645216,-0.004587064,-0.02163029,0.054887306,-0.035031322,-0.08366923,0.0010665569,-0.07885687,0.018326355,-0.07470421,-0.07132178,-0.032362234,-0.031863768,0.021407261,-0.017028213,-0.016565338,-0.03042268,0.06906904,-0.0329677,0.04739875,0.022379244,-1.5599949e-33,0.014595853,0.120724626,-0.0123914825,0.073414706,0.00944988,0.02911129,-0.033271756,-0.022221386,0.04086857,0.039385635,-0.0019644022,-0.0119063305,-0.028916638,0.07370022,0.057486728,0.007338189,-0.023258211,-0.07839734,-0.052194215,-0.09499624,-0.0059537613,0.024068994,0.0068535516,-0.06665317,-0.016656535,0.04715913,-0.12527806,0.017651703,-0.085801266,-0.05731932,-0.01640091,0.052432224,0.028293656,-0.082960546,-5.8576457e-05,0.10839498,0.028584523,-0.037534997,0.04143431,-0.018536847,0.069763705,0.03482979,-0.026847323,-0.12578677,0.035815638,0.07628743,0.046604488,0.040091082,0.038621183,0.017471902,-0.0058319527,0.12860851,-0.015256384,-0.00984863,0.019848224,0.018533139,-0.055769946,-0.03078617,-0.07325944,-0.026996907,-0.0776838,-0.026929144,-0.04346466,-0.026913155,-0.002936474,-0.016249297,0.0033403425,-0.09173038,0.0110469395,0.04875734,0.039970826,-0.054390945,-0.03596809,0.043007143,-0.05975284,-0.059361514,-0.0660784,-0.06775852,-0.06332976,0.085657634,0.07474092,-0.039770056,0.06204841,0.0007334677,-0.045210596,0.01856031,-0.014683122,-0.04433722,-0.010167271,0.068430424,-0.060337055,-0.009305985,-0.071295865,-0.026610712,0.06997262,-4.868498e-08,-0.06073455,0.01052659,0.08526416,-0.06391241,0.004645008,0.04326124,0.016903102,0.0854615,0.024287472,0.015915655,-6.915204e-05,0.011723405,-0.13029067,0.03113284,-0.018029962,0.009270074,0.015570489,0.06667035,-0.015592898,-0.036645293,0.006046173,0.019131564,-0.06982064,0.0086931195,0.093334116,-0.06867759,-0.0036381523,0.11364448,-0.053399675,0.037141744,0.038668435,0.019170009,0.064036116,-0.090050966,0.0034669673,0.08667847,-0.003121895,-0.009206837,0.037386797,0.016091835,-0.017669497,0.11320639,-0.08015107,-0.0010225417,0.0780909,-0.016291948,0.035734277,-0.05212616,-0.027913518,-0.092785075,0.05886557,-0.049815044,-0.041027818,0.034496196,-0.039726265,-0.021466527,-0.07975113,0.056704886,-0.02344866,-0.02161853,0.008585699,0.00278642,0.046207704,-0.026130985,10,-20.401028,10.93668,15
79,"we did linear regression on a data given to us in excel. we calculated xbar,ybar, xsquare , xbar square and thus calculated beta0 and beta1 which will help in predicting y values. we then calculated error and then we plot a scatter plot of x vs y values. also on the same graph created our line using beta0 and beta1. it helps to find how much data is visually far from our prediction. also we noted that we can only predict in the specified range of data not everywhere. we then plotted error scatterplot which was visually seen as randomised enough. we also plotted histogram which was looking uniformly distributed. we also got to know about r2 coefficient of determination which is square of correlation coefficient in case of simple linear regression. then we used analytics tool of excel to get different values of data like beta0,beta1, confidence interval values and f values. we saw there was a difference in number (degree of freedom) in ssr, sse and sst ..  overall we got in depth knowledge of how to do linear

86,"in today's class we went deep into the simple linear regression techniques by using some data in excel. in the data we have only x and y column from which we calculated other terms such as x_bar, y_bar, xbar_sq, ybar_sq, error and many more terms. we also create the scatter plot between x and y and realized that it follows linear model. we have also plot the histogram to check what is the nature of distribution of data. if it's a bell shaped curve then it is good. the scatter plot of errors values display a distinct pattern showing that model has failed to pick-up the inherent pattern in the data. next by using the data analysis tool in excel we created the summary output of an linear regression model giving many values related to regression statistics. another interesting thing is that - one that explains most of the variations in the data is 'good model'. further we learnt about some regression statistics  short forms like  1)sst = measure of total variation in the given dataset.
2)ssr => total variation explained by the regression model and 3) sse => variation not explained by the model, attributed to random errors. coefficient of determination(r^2) which is the square of the correlation coefficient 'r' between x and y. if the x is increasing and y also increases then it have (+ve) correlation. if the x is increasing and y is decreasing then it have (-ve) correlation. we conduct some 'thought' experiments, related to estimating the population mean from the sample mean: assume that from a population we can take multiple good, representative samples, let's say k samples, each of size n. let's call each sample as s_i. using each s_i, we calculate its mean and call it m_i. for samples are good, representative samples of the population, they will result in means m_i that are close to each other. if we collect all the m_i and create a frequency table and a histogram, it's shape will be bell

94,"in today's session we started with implementing simple functions like average, sum of squares for our features and labels and then we used them to find beta_0 and beta_1 for our linear regression line. visualizing the data using scatter plots helps us to find the patterns in out independent and dependent variables. also the errors can be represented using a scatter plot and histograms and for out data the scatter plot had a random pattern. the histogram somewhat represented a uniformity in the errors but it wasn't a normal distribution. also we can use r^2 to see how good our model actually is. if r^2 value is pretty close to 1 it represents most of the variation in the data  captured by the regression line. r^2 = r^2 for slr where r is the correlation coefficient. at the end confidence intervals were discussed and the analysis of our slr model gives out 95% c.i. for both beta_0 and beta_1 on both sides of the distribution which helps us to know the range where our actual values might lie. sampling distributions were also discussed where we take a particular set of samples with a particular size say 'n' the distribution of means of the samples is approximately gaussian or normal and the formula of std error was also discussed which is inversely proportional to sq.root(n) and hence its better to choose a bigger sample size than a sample with smaller size because choosing a bigger n value decreases the standard error and hence the uncertainity is less and our system becomes more

118,"today's lecture was mainly aimed at giving us a first hands on experience with data. we worked with a sample dataset on excel, where we created scatter plots and tried to implement simple linear regression. we used a tool in excel called the data analysis toolpak, which gives us a lot of information about our data and the linear regression statistics. next we discussed about histograms, which is a frequency chart showing the frequency of data distributed into various bins. 
then we studied that in an ideal case, our model should be able to harness all the predictable patterns in the data, leaving the noise or errors to be random. however, if we are able to predict the errors, that means that our model has not captured the trend between the errors. we also studied that if our outcome is dependent on a large number of unknown causes, then the distribution observed is known as a gaussian normal distribution. 
we went on to discuss that a good model is one which can explain most of the variations in our data. we defined 3 terms:
sst = measure of the total variance of the data
sse = sum of squares of the errors / noise variance
ssr = sum of squares of the total variance captured by the regression model 
then we derived a relation between these three terms to be that sst = ssr + sse. now when we divide both the sides by sst, we get a term ssr / sst on the rhs. this term is defined as the coefficient of determination, or r^2. this term tells us how close our model is in measuring the actual variance in the data. this term has a maximum value of 1, and a minimum value of 0. this term should be as close to 1 as possible, which indicates a good model. 
the term is defined as r^2, because for simple linear regression, the coefficient of determination is equal to the square of the correlation coefficient. since correlation coefficient is termed as r, the cod is termed as r^2. however this result doesn't hold true for multiple linear regression. the correlation coefficient is defined as the measure of how y changes with respect to its mean as x changes with respect to its mean. 
we moved on to define a special histogram, which captures the frequency of means of various samples of a given data. such a histogram is called the sampling distribution of the sample mean. it tells us that if we have a good representative sample, then its mean will lie very close to the mean of the population.

122,"### summary of todayâ€™s class: excel tools & simple linear regression (slr)

### **working with excel**

we spent about an hour exploring excel's functionalities for plotting, statistical calculations, and visualizing regression.

1. **statistical calculations:**
    - calculated metrics such as mean (xë‰,yë‰), standard deviation (xstd, ystd), and extra means (xy_).
    - used these values with the slr formula (derived in the previous class) to estimate the parameters of the regression line.
2. **visualization:**
    - plotted the regression line and visualized the errors (differences between actual and predicted values).

### **simple linear regression (slr) in depth:**

1. **prediction range for slr:**
    - predictions are reliable only within the range of the training data. slr does not extrapolate well beyond this range.
    - for predictions outside this range, advanced techniques like time series analysis are recommended.
2. **understanding plots:**
    - **histogram:** shows the frequency of values within bins.
    - **scatter plot:** visualizes data points on a 2d plane using two coordinates.
3. **error analysis:**
    - after fitting the regression line, we calculated the error for each data point and plotted its histogram.
    - **key insight:** if the error histogram follows a normal distribution, it suggests the model captures the overall relationship between input and output well.
    - in cases where errors show a pattern (e.g., parabolic input-output relationships), the regression line is not a good fit.
4. **excelâ€™s data analysis toolkit:**
    - provides key regression metrics like standard error, r2, adjusted r2, multiple r, confidence intervals, p-values, and t-values for the parameters.
5. **evaluating model performance:**
    - r square(coefficient of determination): represents the proportion of variance explained by the regression model relative to the total variance.
    - **why r square is called r square?** in slr, r2 equals the square of the correlation coefficient between input x and output y (denoted by r). however, this equivalence does not hold for multiple regression.
6. **what is standard error?**
    - the standard error measures how much the sample mean deviates, on average, from the population mean. as the sample size increases, uncertainty in predictions decreases, leading to a more accurate model. this is why a lower standard error indicates more precise predictions and a better-fitting model.
    - **given 100 observations, should we treat it as 1 sample of size 100 or 10 samples of size 10?**itâ€™s better to treat it as 1 sample of size 100. the standard error, which is equal to sigma^2 / n, will be smaller with a larger sample size n. this results in higher precision and less variability in

129,"in todayâ€™s hands-on class, we worked with a dataset to perform regression analysis. using excel, we calculated key values like x_bar (average of x) and y_bar (average of y) manually using formulas. we explored the concept of error and its gaussian (normal) distribution, and understood the sum of squares of residuals (ssr), total sum of squares (sst), and explained sum of squares (sse). we discussed how well the variance is captured by the regression line and learned that, for simple linear regression, the coefficient of determination (r square) is the square of the correlation coefficient (r). finally, we used the data analysis toolpak in excel to quickly generate regression statistics for the dataset. additionally, we discussed sampling concepts, including calculating sample means from multiple samples, finding the mean of these sample means, and determining their variance and standard deviation. we understood that there is some relationship between the variance of sample means and the variance of the original

we started with a data of 100 sample points on excel calculating and analyzing the regression line via values of a and b as well as regression function on data analysis toolkit.
we analyzed error by plotting and scatter plot, later proving what we see is not always true by plotting a histogram and finding a rough uniform distribution of error. also a new statement came to me that, when the outcome is dependent on large number of uncommon causes which are random, the distribution id a normal gaussian.
we found that error was not so random in our case and concluded that there are some things/ parameters which the regression model is unable to calculate. 
next we defined what is a good model?
[1] we can determine it by the random distribution of error function and
[2] how much variation can the model explain for the provided data

later, we jumped to the data values provided by the data toolkit where we found the rsquare  values also known as coefficient of determination (ssr/sst) which is square of correlation coefficient in case of simple linear regression.
last, we discussed about the upper 95% and lower 95% confidence bound diving into gaussian distribution and mean of samples and population.",-0.036838472,-0.019291488,0.018256806,0.06356157,0.035980407,-0.004892067,-0.05328631,0.07969852,0.016847193,0.026519427,0.010098507,0.06355216,0.075121894,-0.0013888177,-0.017711608,-0.10783023,0.089224555,-0.10019905,-0.10881403,0.002357832,0.022584904,0.038352188,-0.08321603,0.016042247,0.03743242,-0.057592086,0.027206333,-0.07319195,-0.08259934,-0.01437832,-0.012652373,-0.033429183,-0.054819033,0.06692335,-0.0027143757,-0.04997965,0.01470308,0.0077445596,0.08992272,0.014603041,-0.012588598,-0.044200536,0.031219034,0.069785856,0.05982433,-0.07009329,0.008239128,-0.07760772,-0.024471765,0.03599677,-0.04347333,0.008580976,0.04431057,-0.055081904,0.0008742939,-0.06838607,-0.014194314,-0.05169311,0.08331205,0.029052014,0.04081484,-0.005059578,-0.0023153257,-0.00037221197,0.016114227,-0.01284181,-0.10257782,-0.033749573,-0.0241822,0.08403596,-0.045084935,0.04784305,-0.085987635,0.032561257,-0.019963859,0.009792272,-0.036822755,0.042893905,-0.022450037,-0.03580466,0.06399706,0.028859291,0.004172444,0.053596247,0.029017862,0.029336432,0.07434705,0.07821547,-0.012189189,0.015210299,0.047449727,0.03383369,-0.034755684,0.054946225,0.06469318,0.072436765,0.015828347,-0.086819984,0.041070342,0.030865917,-0.015051285,0.13729145,0.06928462,-0.051452197,-0.0027871043,0.015083304,0.088553205,-0.0114318365,-0.03838945,0.017015189,-0.023896893,-0.013685723,-0.090855196,0.019540695,0.06530937,-0.041721433,-0.09080733,-0.053297125,-0.17504509,0.056168374,-0.0029837242,0.046455402,-0.007609781,0.06897016,-0.025350453,0.07629906,-0.11642677,9.7519856e-33,0.019212652,-0.031722568,-0.044881955,0.09629923,0.0054122075,0.009317909,-0.055394422,0.0087493295,0.032359883,0.10701886,0.009744737,-0.061355174,-0.024765423,-0.022990992,0.037814043,0.14645837,-0.035726737,-0.023207296,-0.05167548,0.08092532,0.04738886,-0.09716958,0.008865761,-0.062124714,-0.06375558,0.05983284,0.003951235,0.071062274,-0.02321712,0.004096052,-0.047745027,0.031373527,0.056534044,-0.027505973,-0.039332144,-0.074964,0.03905857,-0.0006100495,-0.034155153,-0.018835627,-0.0048124352,0.06514341,0.05304204,0.0676512,0.043695513,0.08195483,0.057582647,-0.04393909,-0.0125384955,0.045050077,-0.08093124,0.034801323,-0.019852048,0.051826764,-0.10657176,0.074082226,-0.022086592,-0.061623715,-0.056147605,0.018513523,0.037884235,-0.017391684,-0.06825701,-0.077313974,0.03405449,0.09689083,0.01158665,0.0024446985,-0.027890347,0.046797436,0.043033723,-0.07804606,-0.0075956406,0.030328618,0.047508284,-0.069163196,0.025993437,-0.024590682,0.0063381786,-0.08443938,0.034733813,-0.019847527,-0.037764765,-0.060335144,-0.08133617,-0.030481009,-0.037360325,0.032325085,-0.05696656,-0.0016165627,0.024926646,0.027073199,-0.032799304,0.0012312753,-0.05661859,-9.9308694e-33,-0.04106506,0.07227571,-0.011676195,0.017474186,-0.027345495,-0.032033328,0.013965877,0.049896013,0.03631208,-0.039846554,0.0071556764,-0.0016779297,0.05467421,0.11467383,0.06127157,0.007920666,0.026954282,-0.07291715,0.031789985,-0.027444338,0.026492808,0.015656587,0.0022059095,-0.076622486,-0.03144125,0.12951408,-0.1392724,0.05906562,-0.08186072,-0.018544646,-0.028309973,0.06434056,-0.027750438,-0.03565368,-0.031996053,0.04522055,-0.001690285,0.021712497,0.021867935,-0.06994456,0.015224779,0.057982508,-0.033005316,-0.047623836,0.050860737,0.020638417,0.048836406,0.006171359,0.09369595,-0.016197428,-0.008303022,0.022843285,-0.010817981,0.0582769,0.012664727,0.029697405,-0.08164503,-0.039151642,-0.066498265,0.028551528,-0.025410566,0.015583372,-0.10832124,-0.004450481,-0.04895284,0.04118878,-0.047269486,-0.017494708,0.094929114,0.047075875,-0.0475075,-0.07935377,0.013688517,-0.019128105,-0.014036124,0.051570754,-0.0959569,-0.009422176,-0.008440436,0.1008071,0.047049418,0.048140034,0.015224788,-0.081268474,0.0038860214,-0.070778094,0.017996658,-0.0075808708,0.015073636,0.024324229,-0.09701904,0.012449598,-0.042618502,0.06934844,0.06583438,-7.271012e-08,-0.03277777,0.024983818,0.026834726,-0.032356687,0.009404617,-0.017623994,-0.042317368,-0.015864503,-0.026286308,0.032613244,-0.03687426,-0.049730122,-0.1415743,0.011067668,-0.014700644,0.017733436,-0.012048669,0.07899538,-0.03960504,-0.048891753,0.018052874,-0.027165981,-0.013846897,-0.008821304,0.037717294,-0.0012803671,-0.034785528,0.017037746,-0.030339126,0.069745295,-0.017822025,-0.04270787,-0.022103392,0.019042438,-0.034548152,0.007840085,-0.0046765576,-0.02596082,0.074505925,0.0039299964,0.017398119,0.048167456,-0.051216733,0.040276673,0.042111713,-0.00017156302,0.04340675,-0.08068867,0.050517026,-0.051548425,0.03899329,-0.027525648,-0.08747474,0.035603195,-0.04978533,0.031936523,-0.06988477,0.051870324,-0.07624104,-0.026892444,0.009924016,0.040567324,-0.03801699,-0.039090864,10,-24.432251,9.840841,15
156,"in todayâ€™s lecture we learnt about the implementation of simple linear regression on excel. first we calculated the coefficients of regression by applying formula. then we obtained the scatter plot of data points and the corresponding regression line. we also used direct excel data analysis tool to verify the obtained result. it also gave certain values like r square, adjusted r square, confidence intervals of calculated coefficients etc. we tried to understand the meaning of those parameters. we were also introduced to the concept of histograms and how it gives idea of frequency of values bin-wise. we can determine the distribution of data through histogram. we obtained the method to calculate r square which is dependent on sum of square of errors and residuals. r square lies between 0 and 1. for a good model r squared value is close to 1. for simple linear regression, r squared is simply the square of correlation coefficient between dependent and independent variable. at the end of the lecture, the discussion was centered around the confidence interval and how standard error is calculated.",0.0320037,0.05559462,-0.08938915,0.023344057,-0.03801273,0.08694752,-0.04788242,0.1087597,0.0050472706,0.05562621,0.002716633,0.041291036,0.07499118,-0.00047405844,-0.023466203,-0.081072204,0.030741343,-0.06671879,-0.024484085,-0.07873655,0.084871195,-0.011916129,-0.1175229,-0.07423268,0.09466322,0.0017401022,-0.04755568,-0.011074741,-0.02041004,0.015496451,0.065612875,0.02962008,0.0784438,0.045553222,-0.091713384,-0.07279114,0.04095458,0.04415152,0.09241353,0.0553424,-0.048364803,0.02098935,0.06405254,0.048391294,0.01631347,-0.008694027,-0.031673122,-0.0012856154,-0.035603575,0.007793094,0.0019190393,0.020252174,0.07286368,-0.03686026,0.08202139,-0.060473647,-0.06979254,-0.052515864,0.09423722,0.0299283,0.03807193,-0.039443683,-0.033955526,0.058911692,0.031306785,-0.02932465,-0.06207029,-0.030038662,0.038504682,0.020771457,-0.11413943,0.06624298,-0.035496246,-0.0036708817,-0.017353635,-0.051835865,-0.09232066,0.015021772,-0.055297293,-0.039220802,0.005366368,0.07087524,0.01856781,-0.0034654476,-0.017345816,0.074357666,0.049140673,0.035017133,-0.052394304,0.031603396,0.053101312,0.02954553,-0.0356215,0.061636124,-0.08257064,0.002977116,0.029266018,0.0065092156,0.07369222,-0.0009839663,0.056390323,-0.007425618,0.023413299,-0.007859772,-0.046429362,-0.00023796484,0.053879496,-0.005276902,0.034897726,0.030982869,-0.06674971,-0.029658357,-0.0906194,0.0026282712,0.03429513,-0.002900451,-0.05182052,-0.021382606,-0.026973775,-0.045699745,0.08439089,0.058819808,0.055638973,-0.019256374,-0.033863306,-0.026938979,-0.09606013,4.6879435e-33,-0.026398,0.015573066,-0.022359107,0.034426533,-0.04760939,-0.07186589,-0.0712991,-0.05276384,0.110732414,0.056926463,-0.0069339746,0.026458248,-0.008605957,0.028043533,-0.0007413361,0.10798693,0.039526746,0.017706035,-0.019878995,0.036790904,-0.06179877,-0.048681896,0.08316922,0.010045802,0.02365835,0.060478292,0.03056247,-0.0052802768,0.027584502,0.044888183,0.04848548,0.054318637,-0.030600253,-0.027355004,0.000723904,-0.098797634,0.011646557,0.019275082,0.00013717024,0.06063215,0.048278652,0.04013736,0.019605754,-0.02149323,0.033133574,0.05845039,0.017412968,0.036566082,0.09044069,0.014976813,-0.04780448,0.0014179442,0.016446078,0.017351497,0.034330964,0.11161505,-0.07560873,-0.016955948,-0.0072159944,0.111898944,-0.028201004,0.027409177,0.012255745,-0.054276757,-0.015817493,0.051186863,-0.015769964,-0.027183166,-0.013261835,0.045645554,-0.027504632,-0.02089668,0.02331314,0.0018333995,0.05294344,-0.024652613,-0.01817086,0.008012581,-0.027574461,-0.06203025,-0.04993798,0.013699246,-0.07186163,-0.12425134,-0.07555966,-0.05331803,-0.0022939295,-0.0011608794,-0.060191948,-0.033821158,-0.012599384,0.011542696,-0.0706901,-0.02522159,-0.000945621,-6.1478524e-33,-0.013548797,0.12869297,-0.037710756,0.07212097,-0.021016648,0.035878804,0.018100277,-0.0012704947,0.09157284,-0.013767236,-0.024523975,-0.034565084,-0.02828653,0.088021256,0.05849629,0.017903684,-0.026647428,-0.064563654,-0.14637192,-0.0644234,-0.005222713,-0.0034206798,-0.0022553208,-0.10098673,-0.04799296,0.018582733,-0.10273987,0.006414971,-0.04062138,-0.027289394,0.025558453,0.009513777,-0.084791236,-0.030955197,-0.051417816,0.020890232,-0.01218288,-0.041993216,0.011070971,-0.058915332,0.060437042,0.045219466,-0.017589519,-0.15143202,0.034788433,0.025579812,0.043362558,-0.022801723,0.03691154,-0.08909625,0.000841543,0.084948756,0.020784048,0.043410603,0.066049166,0.009891683,-0.034728553,0.03111995,0.025074214,0.025321973,-0.048306208,-0.074034065,-0.053534247,0.035864398,-0.08154367,0.04118489,-0.043169536,-0.05484328,0.032709345,0.084373705,0.0055076145,-0.041149452,0.07494365,-0.0055143936,-0.062066324,0.0107356915,-0.102985226,-0.11636137,-0.088526204,0.07316875,0.021040475,-0.03538568,0.05297663,-0.00047219073,-0.021275919,-0.07792846,0.009506107,-0.021029992,-0.038820643,0.04653764,-0.026017142,0.038370393,-0.08425991,0.026819991,0.08508271,-5.5393848e-08,-0.03744639,-0.06587994,0.045809224,-0.04346097,0.08565541,0.058408022,-0.012560606,0.027787592,-0.019796774,0.018816333,0.01513852,-0.04176853,-0.07427384,0.005334928,-0.025180863,0.051537722,0.06857979,0.04745882,0.022165485,-0.015126862,-0.003659268,-0.01911085,-0.056948714,-0.013781364,0.020288287,-0.026908565,0.0100019425,0.12264569,-0.035615183,0.047895007,0.028086646,0.026140945,0.020443628,-0.03856283,-0.021572364,-0.011057773,0.030450387,0.025735337,0.051786255,0.0030707198,-0.026946468,0.007870854,-0.053187743,0.021881483,0.08838241,0.11541693,0.058125816,0.01604451,-0.06781347,-0.12884742,0.0055065113,-0.002142334,-0.037193082,0.014099477,-0.038100015,0.00786375,-0.09299117,0.025260555,-0.036431752,-0.032673467,-0.0317261,0.08018773,-0.006610529,-0.080584615,10,-21.351503,13.010431,15
188,"a basic introduction to excel was given . multiple functionalities of excel such as calculation of estimated parameter , means , and errors were discussed . scatter plot of error and given data were plotted . regression line was also superimposed on the scatter plot of the data. if the error has some sort of trend in it, it means that the regression line is not a good fit for the data as it failed to capture the pattern of the data. outcome dependent on large numbers of unknown causes (random) the distribution observed is ""gaussian normal"" distribution. formula for the coefficient of

189,"in today's session, the main focus was on understanding the working of simple linear regression. for this, we used ms excel and data analysis toolpack. we started by finding the terms like x_bar, y_bar, xy_bar, xsq_bar, xbar_sq for the linear regression equation. using these values, we found the values of 'a' and 'b'. these newly found values of 'a' and 'b' will be used in the slr equation: y^ = ax + b. 
we also calculated the error from the data. we represented it first as a scatter plot and then as a histogram. through scatter plot, we noticed that the errors were randomly spread throughout the x-axis. but after plotting errors on histogram, our opinion changed. 
when the output depends on a large number of unknown causes (which are completely random) the distribution should be a gaussian normal distribution. but while plotting a histogram for the errors we did not obtain a gaussian distribution. this suggests that our model of linear regression fails into considering some trends in the data. 
later we spent some time, understanding the concept of variance and correlation coefficient using the data analysis toolkit. we learned about the coefficient of determination (r^2).

194,"summary:

- *histogram: a frequency chart where the height represents the frequency, and the horizontal interval is the class width.

- random data nature: errors in perfectly random data follow a gaussian distribution. if errors show a pattern, the model fails to capture it.

- *key terms:  
  - **ssr (sum of squares for regression)**: variations explained by the regression model.  
  - **sse (sum of squares for error)**: variations due to random errors.  
  - **sst (total sum of squares)**: sst = ssr + sse.  
  - **râ² (coefficient of determination)**: râ² = ssr/sst, representing the squared correlation between x and y.

- *central limit theorem:  
  - calculated means (máµ¢) tend to have a **normal distribution**.  
  - this distribution is called the **sampling distribution of the sample mean**.  
  - *properties:  
    1. the expected value (mean) of the sampling distribution is close to the population mean.

1. linear regression demo in excel: demonstration of linear regression in excel, including visualization and interpretation of results.  

2. histogram & frequency distribution: introduction to histograms as graphical representations of data distribution and frequency distributions to analyze occurrences of values. discussed types of distributions for truly random data.  

3. regression coefficients calculation: regression coefficients (î²â‚€ and î²â‚) were calculated using closed-form expressions rather than iterative methods.  

4. scatter plot of original data: created scatter plots to visualize data points, identify trends, and assess relationships before applying regression models.  

5. error metrics: calculated key error metrics to evaluate model performance, including sse (sum of squared errors), mse (mean squared error), rmse (root mean squared error), and mae (mean absolute error).  

6. example of line force-fitted on non-linear data: demonstrated an example where a linear model was applied to non-linear data, highlighting issues of poor fit.  

7. scatter plot of error values: visualized error values (residuals), noting that a good model should produce randomly distributed residuals without patterns.  

8. criteria for a good model: a good model is one that explains most of the variation in the data and minimizes error.  

9. total variation in dataset (sst): explained sst (total sum of squares) as a measure of total data variability, with components ssr (sum of squares regression) and sse (sum of squares error). the equation sst = ssr + sse + 0 was discussed.  

10. coefficient of determination (râ²): introduced the formula râ² = 1 - (sse/sst), which indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model in slr.  

11. standard deviation: defined as a measure of dispersion and variability within the dataset relative to the mean.  

12. central limit theorem (clt): explained how the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches normality as sample size increases, which is crucial for statistical inference.

249,"we first compared about the estimators being the statistics of the population. later we used excel to perform linear reg with the help of the formula provided in prev and class and performing the linear reg with the help of xlminer toolpack. later we talked about the ei errors in the regression. commenting on the error whether it is random or uniform. usually when the model explains the data variance successfully the errors should be close to a random. how should we comment on randomly distributed errors of regression? it should follow a gaussian distribution. then we can say our model knows all the parameters which can be the reason for the variation of the data. there were several results statistics like r^2 anova which given when we used xlminer. so like r^2 shows how much variation of the data does the particular model explains. we later moved on the proof of r^2 which is derived from sst,ssr,sse. r^2 was ssr/sst. r^2 is also called coef of determination. but why square? for the case of slr, the coeff of determination is the sq(correlation between x&y). since correlation coeff=> r. we call coeff of determination as r^2 (but only for slr(simple linear

285,"this was our first hands on lecture in which we used excel to understand simple linear regression. we first loaded the dataset in excel and crated its scatter plot to identify that the dataset followed a somewhat linear variation. we then calculated various parameters like x*y, x^2, denominator which we used to find out the simple linear regression line parameters beta_0 and beta_1. we then plotted the scatter plot and histogram of the residual terms in slr. we saw that the histogram was kind of uniform rather than a a normally distributed which meant that the errors were not random. we then looked at sst = ssr + sse where sst gives measure of total variation, ssr is variation explained by regression model and sse is variation not explained by regression model. we define coefficient

310,"in today's lecture, we learnt about how to find regression coefficients beta0 and beta1 in excel from a data given in csv file using simple excel formulas of average, square, etc. after calculating beta0 and beta1, we calculated y_cap(estimated parameter) and e_i(error = yi-yi_cap), also plotted scatter plot for xi vs yi and fitted the best fit linear line in it using excel. also plotted scattered plot for error e_i. then plotted a histogram for the errors. if the error histogram looks like random or normal distribution then only our estimation or linear regression is useful, else if error histogram looks somewhat different from random distribution then the estimation using linear regression is said to be not good enough. we also calculated the statistics for the regression using the add-in named data analysis toolpak on excel for that given data which directly gives us all the things and coefficients for simple linear regression. sum of square of errors (sse) was also discussed, that best fit line can also be obtained by minimizing sse. at last we also came to know that how correlation coefficient (r) and coefficient of determination(râ²) are related i.e, (r)â²=(râ²), and, what are the formulas of r and

321,"simple linear regression in excel
	1.	objective: to find the relationship between two variables (dependent and independent) using a straight-line equation:

y = mx + b

where  m  is the slope and  b  is the y-intercept.
	2.	steps in excel:
	â€¢	input data in two columns: one for the independent variable ( x ) and one for the dependent variable ( y ).
	â€¢	use excelâ€™s data analysis toolpak:
	â€¢	go to data > data analysis > regression.
	â€¢	select the input ranges for  x  and  y .
	â€¢	excel generates outputs including the regression equation, r-squared value, and anova table.
	â€¢	alternatively, use the linest function for direct equation parameters.

error metrics

error metrics measure the accuracy of the regression modelâ€™s predictions.
	1.	sum of squares error (sse):

sse = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2

	â€¢	measures total squared error between actual ( y_i ) and predicted ( \hat{y}_i ) values.
	â€¢	lower values indicate a better fit.
	2.	mean squared error (mse):

mse = \frac{sse}{n}

	â€¢	average squared error across all data points.
	â€¢	penalizes larger errors more due to squaring.
	3.	root mean squared error (rmse):

rmse = \sqrt{mse}

	â€¢	provides an error metric in the same units as the dependent variable ( y ).
	â€¢	useful for comparing models.
	4.	mean absolute error (mae):

336,"first of all, we defined all the terms in excel like the x_bar, y_bar, xy_bar, xsq_bar and then used the formula of a and b which we learnt earlier. here, we manually calculated it. we also calculated yi_cap, ei_cap. then we used our scatter plot to show the y vs x. we also made a regression line of yi=ax+b. after doing it manually, we used the extension in which we took help of the data analysis tool kit. we used the regression feature to automatically calculate the the linear regression.we learnt about some terminologies in the tool kit and their importance. we also made a histogram for errors. it is desirable to get a normal distribution, but we didn't get it in our case.  then we learnt about some

339,"we started with discussing how to perform linear regression analysis on a data set and also learnt how to make scatter plots for the same. we also used the data analysis toolpak on excel to perform the regression and got a variety of different statistics.
while performing regression on a certain sample of data, the model is best suited for the points within the sample limit. we can predict the values beyond the sample, but accuracy would not be satisfactory enough. for such cases, we need to use other tools like time series analysis and merely slr is not enough. we made scatter plots for the errors and analyzed the distribution of these errors. through the scatter plot it seemed that the errors were randomly oriented, but after plotting the histogram for the errors, we noticed that there was some kind of uniformity in the distribution of the errors. the histogram plot gives good insights about the distribution of data (errors). if the errors are perfectly random, then the histogram would have more or less a gaussian normal distribution. we also want the errors to be random, which means the trend in the data is well picked by our model. if the error distribution is not completely random, it means our model missed to capture some trend in the data, which is shown up in the errors. we also discussed upon the coefficient of determination, represented by r^2. it is represented so because it is exactly equal to the square of the correlation coefficient between x and y, r. r^2 is the ratio of sum of squares of variation that is captured by our model to that of the variation that is actually present in the data. so, we want our model to capture maximum variation in the data. hence, we want r^2 to be as close to 1 as possible. the total variance in the data is equal to the sum of variance captured by the model and the squares of errors.

363,"this session was mainly focused on simple linear regression.
in the starting of the session we learnt how to implement a simple linear regression model in ms excel using two ways which were as follows:
1) manually entering the formulas for calculating the regression coefficients:- here we first calculated all the required entities to calculate the regression coefficients that are xbar, ybar, xy, xybar, xsqbar etc. after this using the derived formula we calculate the regression coefficients beta0 and beta1. after that we created a scatter plot of the data as well as the predicted values using the regression coefficients.

2) using data analysis tool - just select the data and you will get a complete analysis of the data along with the regression coefficients there confidence intervals, r2 score etc.

after this we learnt how to decide whether a model is a ""good model"" or not. a good model is a model that is able to explain the variation in the data. for this we calculate metrics like r2 (c.o.d), co-relation and co-relation coefficient. we have other metrics also like mae, mse etc. we train the model on a sample of the population so we want to create a general model which can generalize things well and do prediction for population. we create confidence intervals. and the class ended with the discussion on the central limit theorem.

376,"the class started with the recap of the previous class. we looked at an example of linear regression today , used a csv file for data and excel as tool to analyse the data. we used the formulas obtained for ""a"" and ""b"" for one dimensional simple linear regression which were derived in the previous class. used the formula methods of the excel to find error term of the  slr and plotted a scatter plot of the data with the predicted line. then we plotted a scatter plot of the error. learnt that the errors as to be random that is there should be no trend in the error plot. if there is a trend left in the error plot it suggests that the model is best there can be improvements. we used the in built regression tool of the excel to get various analysis scores of the linear model. we discussed about the rsqr term it measures how much of the actual variance is captured by the regression line. higher r^2 value means model is good.  we started the discussion on how to find the lower

410,"summary of today's lecture: histograms help visualize data distribution; mismatched error histograms indicate poor model fit. in excel, linear regression was performed using a csv file, with scatterplots showing random errors and a uniform error distribution in the histogram. statistical concepts covered include sst (total variation), ssr (explained variation), and sse (unexplained variation). râ² measures model fit, while the correlation coefficient (r) indicates relationship strength. confidence intervals were derived from regression coefficients, with sample means forming a normal distribution. the session also covered râ², 95% confidence intervals, and positive/negative correlations, emphasizing practical application in

418,"1. understanding the generated outputs  
   - when using built-in linear regression (lr) tools such as excel, several statistical values are generated, which help in interpreting the model's effectiveness and reliability.  

2. sample vs. population  
   - the given dataset (x, y) represents a sample (99 observations), and the calculated regression coefficients (intercept 'a' and slope 'b') are only estimates of the true population values.  
   - the goal is to develop a general model that can predict values beyond the given sample and reflect the actual population behavior.  

3. key statistical values explained  
   - regression statistics  
     - multiple r: represents the correlation between predicted and actual values.  
     - r square (râ²): measures how well the independent variable explains the variation in the dependent variable.  
     - adjusted r square: adjusts râ² for the number of predictors, providing a more accurate measure when multiple variables are involved.  
     - standard error: indicates the average error in predictions.  
     - observations: number of data points used in the model.  

   - anova (analysis of variance)  
     - ss (sum of squares): measures total variation in data, divided into regression (explained) and residual (unexplained) parts.  
     - ms (mean squares): average squared deviation, derived from ss.  
     - f-statistic: tests the overall significance of the regression model.  
     - significance f (p-value): determines if the independent variable has a statistically significant effect on the dependent variable.  

   - regression coefficients table  
     - coefficients (intercept and slope): estimated values for the regression equation.  
     - standard error: measures variability in the coefficient estimates.  
     - t-stat: tests whether each coefficient is significantly different from zero.  
     - p-value: indicates the statistical significance of the coefficients.  
     - lower/upper 95%: confidence interval for the coefficients, indicating the range within which the true population parameter likely falls.  

4. importance of statistical confidence  
   - emphasized the need to evaluate how reliable the coefficient estimates (a, b) are.  
   - concepts of sampling distributions and confidence intervals were introduced to understand the variability and precision of these estimates.

457,"in today's session, we explored the process of performing linear regression using excel. we began by analyzing a scatter plot of the data, which exhibited a linear trend, prompting us to apply linear regression. using the closed form expressions derived earlier, we calculated the regression coefficients and plotted the regression line over the scatter plot of the original data. this provided a visual representation of the relationship between the variables.
we learned that predictions made using a regression model are valid only within the range of data on which the model was trained. extrapolating beyond this range can lead to inaccurate predictions. to assess the model's performance, we examined the residuals by creating a scatter plot and a histogram. the scatter plot of residuals appeared random, but upon further inspection, the histogram indicated a somewhat uniform distribution rather than the expected normal distribution. an example was provided where a regression line was force-fitted onto non-linear data, resulting in a pattern in the residuals. this demonstrated the model's failure to capture the underlying trend, emphasizing the importance of a good model that effectively explains the variation in the data. additionally, we derived the relationship sst=ssr+sse, where sst represents the total variance in the data, ssr is the component explained by the regression model, and sse represents the unexplained variance. the coefficient of determination r^2 was explained as the ratio ssr/sst, indicating the proportion of variation in the data that the model accounts for. r^2=r^2 ,here r is coefficient of correlation which indicated how y changes with respect to x.

463,"the class started with a hands on demo. sir uploaded a file on moodle. we then downloaded the file and applied simple linear regression on it. sir then explained about some features in excel and how to use them. sir then focused on errors in linear regression. then sir explained about histogram. outcome dependent on a large number of unknown causes(random), the distribution is gaussian normal distribution.
we need to understand what each number we get from analysis tells us. lower and upper 95% means that the real value of population lies with 95% confidence in the interval [lower 95,upper 95].
what is a good model- one that explains most of the variations in the data. 
sst=sum of (yi-y_bar)â² (measure of total variation in given dataset)
sst=sse+ssr
ssr- sum of square of regression line (total variation explained by the regression line)
sse- variation not explained by the model, attributed to random errors. 
sst=ssr+sse
1=(ssr/sst)+sse/sst
ssr/sst portion of total variation described by the regression model. for a nice model we need this value to be as high as possible. this value is called r squared value. lies in between 0 and 1.  this is known as coefficient of determination. for the case of simple linear regression, the coefficient of determination is same as square of the correlation coefficient r between x and y. so this is called 'r square'. correlation coefficient of x and y=cov(xy)/root(var(x)*var(y))

482,"in today's class, we revisited the formula for a and b in the simple linear regression equation:
y = ax + b.

using a csv file in excel, we created columns for y_predicted and error. before that, we calculated the averages (xì„ and yì„), as well as xx_bar, xy_bar, and xì„â². from these values, we calculated a and b, which were used to compute y_predicted. the error was calculated as the difference between the actual y and the predicted y.

we plotted the best-fit line for our data and then visualized the errors. on a 2-d scatter plot, the errors looked fine, but when plotted as a histogram, they did not follow a gaussian (normal) distribution. this indicated that the model couldn't fully capture some trends in the data.

next, we used the regression feature in excelâ€™s data analysis toolpack to get statistical details about the regression model. we learned that the standard error measures how much the sample mean varies from the population mean. additionally, we discussed that for many samples, the distribution of sample means tends to follow a normal distribution.

lastly, we introduced three key terms:

sst (total sum of squares): measures the total variation in the data.
ssr (regression sum of squares): the variation explained by the model.
sse (error sum of squares): the variation not explained by the model.
these terms are related by the formula:
sst = ssr + sse

the râ² value, calculated as râ² = ssr / sst, represents the proportion of the total variation explained by the model.

505,"when predicting with a given sample size using linear regression (or any regression), there are limits. we can make predictions, but only up to a certain point , not far beyond the sample.

time series analysis: time series analysis helps to predict beyond the sample size. 

understanding f(x): in the equation ð‘“(ð‘¥)=ð‘¦ , the trend of the data is the signal, while the deviations are the noise. if there is a trend in the noise, it means your model has not captured the trend perfectly.

histogram: a histogram is simply a frequency chart that shows how often different values appear in a dataset.

a good model: a good model is one that explains most of the variation in the data.

in simple linear regression (slr):
sst=sse+ssr
where:
sse: sum of squares of errors, or the variation not explained by the regression line.
ssr: sum of squares of regression, or the total variation explained by the regression line.

r-squared (râ²):
râ² = ssr/sst = 1 - sse/sst 
râ² is the coefficient of determination, which measures how well the regression model explains the variation in the data.

why râ² and not r? in simple linear regression (slr), the coefficient of determination (râ²) is exactly the same as the square of the correlation coefficient between ð‘¥ and ð‘¦ this is why we use râ²  rather than ð‘….

we also created an excel program for linear regression and learned about some of the major terms used to evaluate how well the model explains the variation in the data.",0.014551098,0.009003127,-0.027815603,0.0012364147,0.027076673,0.07401203,-0.04211095,0.0964173,0.015581851,0.0056917453,-0.06496455,-0.0022864342,0.004831612,0.031917468,0.016391942,-0.10814103,-0.010836988,-0.09549976,-0.0116626145,-0.12281148,0.08357504,-0.027917052,-0.050038867,9.504898e-05,-0.008987109,0.025669236,-0.017905472,-0.027355013,-0.054034892,0.018229326,0.034838796,0.010793752,0.065398045,0.026289586,-0.08655833,-0.036936767,-0.005743127,0.089569226,0.06608163,0.007331094,0.016595233,0.02712842,0.042005174,0.07733205,0.059453472,0.008140956,0.06250558,-0.0603505,-0.024871608,0.08635196,-0.03919312,0.017216524,0.05970965,-0.0072993482,-0.019096648,-0.071573004,-0.01886735,-0.022549465,0.08127961,-0.044135824,-0.028824013,-0.028532594,-0.02214295,0.0041960226,0.023682993,-0.014672911,-0.004544869,-0.011307095,-0.014181972,0.08141626,0.01084121,0.1247204,-0.004275122,0.038163032,0.033322103,-0.06369004,-0.024954969,0.040451925,0.03945463,0.004334621,-0.015312065,0.02721986,0.029696304,-0.08168075,0.0053143376,0.050302256,0.066119365,-0.033709586,-0.05384579,0.08066056,0.01369151,-0.045233637,-0.10536599,0.02692831,-0.007076909,0.09265931,0.0013940018,-0.019236939,0.04126694,0.007431114,0.06746515,0.05183147,0.026112681,0.048653316,0.09140035,-0.017135166,0.012428273,-0.04740205,0.0029200693,0.03989957,-0.064436555,0.036964905,-0.0655708,-0.033400707,0.106408864,-0.03559443,-0.07330417,-0.002017382,-0.15265103,0.02691419,0.022180213,-0.016493652,-0.058157668,0.06401228,0.029802486,0.060562868,-0.097587965,7.0017344e-33,-0.041692812,0.020141315,-0.025475053,0.006446002,-0.02733469,-0.046331145,-0.06601254,0.0043283706,0.069799565,0.085345596,-0.0057368544,0.0031618073,0.022880333,0.03169929,0.054330323,0.055978075,0.019232308,-0.050545998,-0.0045254556,-0.063875385,-0.08568222,-0.11336987,0.031696755,0.010028188,-0.016234117,0.018811278,0.023870906,0.051174376,-0.045553308,-0.005253335,-0.03704209,0.06338609,0.030022826,-0.039180666,0.07105084,-0.13035287,0.0023092816,-0.022735031,-0.0092331525,0.03967084,0.06003014,-0.0049154395,-0.028604018,0.027550256,0.09604748,0.061951485,0.008309616,-0.05121011,-0.06712565,0.11371463,-0.033227425,0.00056404324,-0.04811342,0.032510016,0.022891846,0.098303005,0.02947206,-0.07053849,0.0006278431,0.052852474,-0.02665736,-0.06104339,0.060188647,-0.0007511858,0.035540044,0.0385448,0.018079195,0.03921434,-0.008734277,0.027685035,0.056889363,-0.031234186,-0.0054896586,0.019454734,0.036838103,-0.04711637,-0.003707005,0.026222648,-0.064421415,-0.0012009562,-0.009058714,-0.07076643,-0.0062949145,-0.071070276,-0.044044204,-0.028719299,0.010601405,-0.009640923,-0.025045112,-0.034141317,-0.07435704,0.03479317,-0.004941547,0.032618612,-0.042527907,-8.844096e-33,-0.024372974,0.095960215,-0.009683438,0.042699724,-0.008902926,-0.0071502808,-0.038248252,0.084488034,0.024728242,-0.02764174,0.012325122,-0.0098287165,0.08306436,0.0005160313,-0.042177945,0.022138886,0.033494964,-0.08247327,-0.046035003,0.01274983,-0.063693,-0.009787647,-0.0114835845,-0.062375404,-0.053454172,0.026513865,-0.12793046,0.07972391,-0.0053432365,-0.04863304,-0.053872712,0.0033009686,0.051195312,-0.11330684,0.004623919,0.0056861695,0.024861874,-0.015745042,0.014617045,0.04715514,0.065891065,0.0704433,0.07498374,-0.12564349,-0.034868687,0.029956523,0.0014231479,0.05597875,0.06715693,0.03716614,0.05631208,0.11240845,-0.04567411,0.04784899,0.014158978,-0.007355901,-0.06859668,-0.0008207376,-0.035184253,0.009759929,-0.025547303,-0.020337226,-0.055449847,0.020379763,-0.09189712,-0.02193081,-0.06199725,-0.07903467,0.073999785,0.045750644,-0.053814325,-0.080533385,0.03752414,0.039325282,-0.13948968,-0.050981916,-0.03571099,-0.06448128,-0.0055859275,0.014045536,-0.0310345,-0.010431493,0.020338632,-0.046800952,-0.0975678,-0.037255306,-0.054647766,-0.019206835,-0.028166916,0.0070355004,0.013870419,-0.0022976599,-0.108120725,0.048083227,0.05542948,-7.4111654e-08,-0.0779531,-0.010383331,0.058602754,-0.07829825,0.0937944,-0.00968609,0.025403026,-0.03949224,0.01443569,0.025476158,0.1066382,-0.004121307,-0.13723417,0.008782168,0.0106005715,0.00032253348,0.057754096,0.016451966,-0.0018368104,-0.073866196,-0.07211305,-0.03359317,0.0037919586,-0.06672003,0.092504464,-0.022066636,0.019196186,0.11945399,-0.038717624,0.022478305,0.013205868,0.034755502,0.05105584,-0.0347868,-0.037094958,0.0055628093,0.0016711839,-0.023823984,0.07947061,-0.0044428376,0.004974776,0.025084632,-0.03673069,0.00030122948,-0.050146505,0.042008724,0.14848526,-0.03032482,0.00641849,-0.02549775,0.021306485,-0.007634092,0.01087826,-0.088856086,0.024026878,0.09776089,-0.037737098,0.043278523,-0.06960914,-0.022717414,-0.021953253,-0.053391296,-0.0089358995,-0.028642409,10,-24.802084,12.618553,15
568,"we worked on understanding regression analysis using a dataset of 100 sample points in excel. the primary focus was on calculating the regression line, represented by b (intercept) and a (slope), and using excelâ€™s data analysis toolkit to derive and analyze the regression function. we evaluated the errors by plotting a scatter plot and a histogram. interestingly, the histogram revealed a roughly uniform error distribution, emphasizing that visual interpretation of scatter plots can sometimes be misleading. 
we then discussed the characteristics of a good regression model:
the error distribution should be random.
the model should explain a significant portion of the data's variation.

602,"discussed the purpose of histograms in visualizing data distribution. learned that when the output is influenced by many unknown random causes, the observed distribution may follow a normal distribution. highlighted that an error histogram not matching the norma distribution indicates the model fails to capture the trend in the error function.

uploaded a csv file into excel for analysis. performed linear regression to fit a model and plotted scatterplots:scatterplots for x vs. y and for errors were created. errors appeared random in the scatterplot but showed a uniform distribution in the histogram.

   - defined sst (sum of squares total), which is the total variation in the data.
     - sst = ssr (sum of squares regression) + sse (sum of squares error).
     - sse captures variation not explained by the model (random error).
     - ssr captures variation explained by the regression line.
   - introduced râ² (coefficient of determination)
     - râ² = ssr / sst.
     - a higher râ² indicates that more variance is captured by the model.
   - correlation coefficient (r) in simple linear regression:
     - r = âˆš(râ²), representing the strength and direction of the relationship.

explained how to derive confidence intervals using regression coefficients (bâ‚€ and bâ‚).divided the sample into subsets, calculated their means, and plotted a histogram of means, which resembled a normal distribution due to randomness.

  explored terms like râ², 95% confidence interval, and their interpretation in regression output. discussed positive and negative correlations.",0.02514436,0.038967393,-0.016648063,0.02458938,0.036552038,0.07225718,-0.044249248,0.0949081,0.023134738,0.029347856,-0.015731063,-0.0020000022,0.11621726,-0.019202145,-0.026334845,-0.07428682,0.047509156,-0.023514746,-0.044186797,-0.08070309,0.08902037,0.0075287046,-0.107054226,-0.046533883,0.05739705,0.00046782297,-0.051264275,-0.0076202913,-0.066476844,0.048806265,0.06010939,-0.032794934,-0.007838249,0.040738706,-0.05422588,-0.07533442,0.016890232,0.080095746,0.053020563,0.0004330523,-0.033504672,0.03533287,0.035224523,0.095475316,-0.016623233,0.001977068,-0.006659558,-0.0644639,-0.043938555,0.0036525321,-0.05767018,-0.010532589,0.03112173,-0.055371433,-0.01612428,-0.014760084,-0.016746202,-0.08228464,0.10728382,0.014272401,0.03097247,-0.024027487,-0.024833545,0.048894957,0.052394256,0.016221257,-0.006612525,0.043884058,0.038664818,0.04406742,-0.07061222,0.10534635,-0.06039605,0.041474067,-0.04847322,-0.0041870866,-0.07522496,-0.015289612,-0.020177959,-0.0747762,0.00072488125,0.12805054,0.056157228,0.045204584,0.032992043,0.050953813,0.016414292,0.03313572,-0.054042988,0.07023413,0.035967447,-0.021955656,-0.11798415,0.017064454,-0.08286494,0.024478206,-0.0065662777,-0.045083173,0.086458065,-0.010765208,0.07039116,0.005758401,0.025712289,-0.02919845,0.010976121,0.014625659,0.04723615,-0.013368055,0.007052889,0.07214023,-0.06157835,-0.03135764,-0.13629527,-0.010294037,0.059704874,0.0556914,-0.120662816,0.025546318,-0.071556896,-0.058751844,0.036874656,0.034442104,0.011006593,0.039379835,0.020948328,-0.019003449,-0.08938049,7.2969965e-33,-0.0054280083,-0.014633526,-0.019772962,0.046292547,0.007182297,-0.022464918,-0.12368079,-0.05349607,0.05472113,0.0583266,-0.008125164,0.029410282,0.0046681943,0.0028088128,-0.025861066,0.08815417,0.013001805,-0.00062690885,-0.05411742,0.0070609823,-0.06375689,-0.08905702,0.05996571,0.052846823,0.01669352,-0.0057645612,-0.011056466,0.05606855,-0.024140812,0.037426706,-0.013689649,0.078298174,0.018504461,-0.041548975,0.008039901,-0.14886704,0.031431053,-0.013906284,-0.0294671,0.08165316,0.08195053,0.061698373,0.019806564,0.04739007,0.059892677,0.061398003,0.02639866,0.03353652,0.06510784,-0.003170588,-0.0639074,0.043392163,-0.0033664184,-0.047539562,0.033409737,0.079644784,-0.0016057125,-0.0147825135,0.025221653,0.016736405,-0.026942093,-0.02075176,-0.0025612898,-0.060623813,0.062380522,0.04787651,-0.026144201,0.008289232,-0.047079593,0.061425712,-0.013349578,-0.026510473,-0.027488051,0.024353523,0.06379737,-0.029675102,-0.03054344,0.111287825,-0.03311962,-0.067571096,-0.031232854,-0.07487663,-0.09183078,-0.08471045,-0.051782258,-0.037682038,0.016755518,0.01776065,-0.07343921,-0.040635712,0.034350067,0.004469802,-0.02906206,0.022294648,-0.039966285,-8.523222e-33,-0.09014883,0.18903877,0.014944866,0.04769929,-0.033688873,0.052710522,0.0256537,0.040487345,0.0676678,-0.027820505,-0.034743905,-0.04137486,-0.05407118,0.048159182,0.014427018,0.023017533,0.014353555,-0.047290176,-0.09874282,-0.03381122,0.015537549,0.032776058,0.018588513,-0.040955957,-0.016591825,0.0684955,-0.08406827,0.07711794,-0.041975215,-0.010382975,0.025812618,0.017246373,-0.03499496,-0.08535179,-0.04216979,-0.012881737,-0.038761582,-0.024025476,0.0058797514,-0.02182966,0.05922781,0.026796326,0.016587429,-0.14321128,-0.02183557,0.05867528,0.06872341,-0.042400695,0.07284171,-0.055060055,-0.0066279187,0.080074705,-0.036406018,0.046377055,0.023108698,-0.02753708,-0.025155352,0.019256601,-0.022773257,-0.008845012,-0.024621118,-0.021678772,-0.04973154,-0.010896614,-0.055164244,0.011489959,-0.036538158,-0.058546964,0.06131096,0.04753504,-0.03208892,-0.08069484,0.058601994,-0.06826788,-0.03972337,-0.0042304294,-0.049853247,-0.015427868,-0.07429321,0.10361866,0.039037555,-0.04462246,0.105749905,-0.0038330592,-0.0026272065,-0.011889347,-0.06402241,-0.00039258326,0.024975223,0.07966657,0.0011368603,-0.0022079626,-0.07827167,0.051401846,0.14157929,-6.558528e-08,-0.05847649,-0.049687754,0.03908673,-0.05486525,0.06412144,0.024409276,-0.053009104,0.012406266,-0.030656833,-0.03449812,0.015124038,-0.036543727,-0.11032864,-0.061872978,-0.010551981,0.009161691,0.040526137,0.058357745,-0.0039007715,-0.010692832,-0.04002226,-0.06819275,-0.015374671,-0.047822364,-0.0019088698,0.01865676,-0.024159087,0.06192752,0.012589379,0.031193709,0.0072859637,-0.04598684,0.041152116,-0.03773984,-0.023104453,0.0022668946,-0.007507499,-0.025171906,0.10050185,0.009614013,0.011084859,0.009719438,-0.012390441,0.055345904,0.06541681,0.08898693,0.11145796,0.022512453,-0.029747216,-0.07920243,-0.035534855,-0.044608805,-0.04517794,0.03915138,-0.0076538594,0.0045739505,-0.036968008,0.038590733,-0.06538257,-0.02239281,-0.018694261,0.0013115082,-0.030331204,-0.07853684,10,-22.539455,13.217118,15
619,"hands-on linear regression analysis with excel

1. introduction

this lecture focuses on practical application of linear regression concepts using excel.
we utilize the linear regression formula derived in the previous lecture to calculate the slope and intercept of the best-fit line directly within excel.
the best-fit line is then plotted on the data.
2. limitations of extrapolation

question: can we make reliable predictions for data points outside the observed range (edge points)?
answer: no. accurate extrapolation requires sufficient data points within the target region to ensure the linear regression model remains valid.
3. analyzing prediction errors

we plot the error (difference between predicted and actual values) for each data point.
observation: the errors appear random.
question: what is the expected distribution of these random errors?
4. distribution of random errors

central limit theorem: when an outcome is influenced by numerous independent random factors, the distribution of the observed results tends to follow a gaussian (normal) distribution.
we create a histogram of the prediction errors to visually examine their distribution.
5. automated linear regression with excel

we utilize the ""data analysis"" tool in excel to perform linear regression automatically.
this provides a wealth of statistical output.
6. evaluating model fit

key concept: a good model effectively explains the maximum variation in the data.
decomposition of variance:
sst (total sum of squares): total variation in the dependent variable (y).
ssr (regression sum of squares): variation in y explained by the regression model.
sse (error sum of squares): variation in y not explained by the model, attributed to random error.
coefficient of determination (r-squared):
r-squared = ssr / sst
r-squared quantifies the proportion of total variation explained by the regression model.
in simple linear regression, r-squared is also equal to the square of the correlation coefficient (r) between the independent (x) and dependent (y) variables.",-0.091216296,-0.008300913,0.006312132,0.03385629,0.08617164,0.006694064,-0.016642427,0.023717847,-0.0053997934,0.020755691,0.028431587,-0.013948879,0.08597143,-0.053753432,-0.0065328055,-0.010876182,0.03389775,-0.04072691,-0.067131616,-0.023018038,0.065191515,0.0003675288,-0.0707551,-0.03206165,0.07947355,-0.019511253,0.016089551,-0.045009583,-0.1406356,-0.016861487,-0.017610034,-0.056025114,0.030141909,0.03842199,-0.013043085,-0.086117364,-0.04418596,0.080659315,0.060772188,0.015461393,0.0066878404,-0.008174323,0.102573276,0.07575193,0.058440674,-0.036561705,-0.0012347881,-0.090262,-0.028287973,0.06621785,-0.047876235,-0.007719735,0.04956093,-0.01531178,-0.0024452878,-0.09666806,-0.0069358414,-0.073166095,0.13247639,0.001285708,0.08659738,0.006789708,-0.034033787,0.042100605,-0.04839102,-0.0362861,-0.018611738,0.014260389,-0.085437745,0.036241274,-0.11599653,0.045745797,-0.068358265,0.002396931,0.0013253608,0.017707765,-0.07875327,-0.0009680913,-0.084510155,-0.0076829134,0.009991801,0.07251318,0.06494084,-0.0026376718,0.0064099585,0.0373418,0.0886608,0.074992746,-0.006806327,0.060672533,0.01069803,0.014683978,-0.073574536,0.08132715,0.029228635,0.07311014,0.030736148,-0.14608765,0.0921293,0.017857218,0.05109808,0.05643484,0.05534792,-0.04467524,-0.0053112237,-0.035038233,0.056693707,0.031399976,0.016225964,-0.045301136,-0.039278984,-0.056445833,-0.046350364,-0.030984104,0.05247809,-0.046665505,-0.037226327,0.0005006105,-0.089322515,0.014523166,-0.028782615,0.06335282,0.08397574,0.03590439,0.027617179,0.017473133,-0.12057895,3.8617495e-33,-0.037969496,-0.009992582,-0.0030777364,0.032049485,0.034490045,-0.0049070353,-0.041067284,-0.018839112,0.049883433,0.051362403,-0.04720318,-0.07458456,0.007510971,0.03807569,0.0042636152,0.1274221,0.03383938,-0.0008402783,-0.06670348,0.09306352,0.00781335,-0.10569058,0.01809153,-0.05700745,-0.02678441,0.060449712,0.027723782,0.045445815,-0.0051100445,0.0058021015,-0.018134687,0.073595494,0.008678568,-0.066306055,0.0051423176,-0.06770134,0.046855673,-0.027056873,-0.006070826,-0.00427368,0.01918254,0.0650558,0.042742055,0.03926688,0.039773803,0.041928034,0.016976701,0.03731283,0.06349364,-0.011588197,-0.033355683,0.002447409,-0.014181182,0.012030225,-0.05600256,0.14175402,-0.060441796,-0.024846897,-0.0072326437,0.029995026,-0.04156973,-0.0066092107,-0.042154215,-0.045896374,0.011424875,0.053435132,-0.0023710632,0.029105905,0.039490897,0.0460231,0.029370131,-0.08402368,0.006540864,0.044233553,0.010786229,0.007977199,-0.002276921,0.010068704,0.020775024,-0.0610269,0.020742329,0.00027592765,-0.056110207,-0.07477281,-0.08422873,-0.09165483,-0.018663952,-0.009661324,-0.057980333,-0.011187258,-0.03243157,0.008674331,-0.06122227,0.04748135,-0.043463405,-4.6538872e-33,-0.0026528086,0.11458975,0.03889979,0.017367676,0.048665576,-0.002461403,-0.042201806,-0.023660475,0.086945124,-0.020874562,-0.08988527,0.0014481143,0.060571514,0.09968052,0.006105186,0.016427832,-0.0051028295,-0.03928435,-0.05292553,-0.05243685,-0.016150601,-0.007528734,-0.013094313,-0.0061970754,-0.0021775053,0.06526358,-0.13432269,0.072415106,-0.10911432,-0.07407192,-0.057604805,0.05937271,-0.006582628,-0.04281415,0.011552687,0.063351855,0.029457554,-0.009167805,-0.008120118,-0.028270502,0.05489714,0.02478811,-0.020521976,-0.11761586,0.088895015,0.05040259,0.046320077,0.021276541,0.009269085,0.061249524,-0.080695204,0.08587383,-0.08845104,0.04541807,-0.018935027,0.026278637,-0.08230837,0.03719632,-0.04633574,-0.0021370216,-0.07006731,-0.020666776,-0.0011533196,0.0244079,-0.021587795,0.060070977,-0.040039666,-0.047296695,0.092140324,0.03836148,-0.049295228,-0.073083706,-0.008429844,-0.011807834,0.030095303,-0.032911126,-0.004608998,-0.1108035,-0.007922339,0.057834294,0.06288033,-0.031278495,0.063341945,-0.01155472,0.014425348,0.0111027695,0.03473733,-0.032056406,0.03415417,-0.052971125,-0.07836418,0.04503186,-0.07697693,0.028322883,0.026579952,-5.1577686e-08,-0.08452693,0.063072324,0.040250793,-0.0019818086,0.03592534,0.0075733974,0.00021131612,0.0038730798,-0.02097177,-0.08862898,0.05251595,-0.0496373,-0.07929071,0.051503606,0.024606511,0.053990737,-0.011643168,0.06012034,-0.0044086673,-0.007635436,-0.050345827,-0.011009486,-0.036467254,-0.023628501,0.04417762,-0.084819816,-0.0011462884,0.108115874,-0.0060805464,0.08989721,0.023431728,-0.047989286,0.0112118935,-0.041723058,0.0177316,0.049625434,0.022385944,-0.058616806,0.09103482,0.028842298,0.036396068,0.026548121,-0.010990288,-0.01228158,0.067849495,-0.01920263,0.062924825,-0.041462358,0.032597892,-0.11551648,0.07701595,-0.06508035,-0.028544197,0.043179613,0.035438992,0.013919929,-0.082323074,0.047162116,0.011503025,0.0046549276,-0.0034381659,-0.0076787365,-0.018787052,-0.03065583,10,-21.001564,9.359584,15
633,"in today's class we took a sample data with 100 data points and found out the best fit line using simple linear regression in ms excel. we calculated the values of 'a' and 'b' using the data to get the regression line y(hat) = a*x + b. we plotted a scatter plot between x and y and also added the y(hat) points on the same graph. then we calculated the error values
ei = yi - yi(hat) and plotted the error values on a scatter plot and a histogram as well. for a perfectly random data the error values should be a normal distribution (bell curve) on the histogram, which is not the case as we observed so we say that the model failed to pick up the pattern in the data.
then we used the data analysis tools for linear regression to get various information about the sample data.

then we moved on to discuss ""what is a good model?"" 
the model that explains most of the variations in the data.
sst = summation(yi - ybar)^2
sst = sse + ssr 
1 = sse/sst + ssr/sst
1 = r^2 + sse/sst
r^2 = 1 - sse/sst
r^2 : coefficient of determination
in case of simple linear regression coefficient of determination is same as the square of correlation coefficient 'r'.  
r^2 = r^2


when drawing k representative samples (si) of size n from a population, the means of these samples (mi) are expected to be similar due to their representativeness. if we plot the frequency distribution of mi, we typically get a histogram that resembles a normal distribution, as suggested by the central limit theorem. this histogram illustrates the sampling distribution of the sample mean. important characteristics of this distribution include that its mean is close to the population mean, and its standard deviation, known as the standard error (sx), is connected to the population standard deviation (sigma) and the sample size (n). these characteristics highlight the advantage of using multiple smaller samples rather than relying on a single large one, as the sampling distribution offers valuable insights into the population's

650,"in today's session, we learned how to do simple linear regression in excel using its built-in functions. we used scatter plots and histograms to analyze the nature of the data and check whether it is normally distributed. in addition, we explored various statistical parameters of the given csv file to understand the dataset better.
