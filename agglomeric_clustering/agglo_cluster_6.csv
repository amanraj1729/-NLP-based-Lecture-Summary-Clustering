15,"in today's lecture, sir discussed steps to solve problem in ds, 1. understanding the problem 2. exploring data analysis (eda) 3. visualization.  the method crisp-dm (cross industry standard process for data mining) is like a sop for problem solving; it has six steps which are run cyclically : business understanding,  data understanding,  data preparation,  modeling, evaluation, deployment. a term known as heteroscadacity means that the variance is also varing (the assumption that the variance remains same for all data is no longer valid). then ta explained steps of eda with examples of pima india diabetes dataset, ganga water quality 2012, aqi of different areas in mumbai. then he discussed about box plot, matrix plot,etc helps analysis and how class imbalance affect the analysis. after that we learnt how to handle missing data (mcar, mar & mnar are types of missing data). there are with univariate and multivariate approaches to fix missing data. univariate solution involves options like 1. delete the entire column/row of that particular entry or 2. replace the missing data with mean, median or mode whichever is suitable. multivariate approach involves options like knn (kth nearest neighbor), mice, fatal regression model,etc. then we learnt how to handle outliers (outliers arises due to 1. data corruption,  2. faulty measurements & 3. true outliers). handling outliers also involves univariate(isolation forest) and multivariate approach(db scan). there are techniques through which one can determine which value is outliers (one of the example is you drop the value of the outlier if it lies outside the certain tolerance interval of iqr(inter-quantile range). also, median is not influenced by the outliers whereas mean is influenced by the outliers. thus median is oftenly used to isolate outliers.",-0.037213176,0.022798425,0.01974895,-0.02034809,-0.021638213,-0.031547375,-0.014232136,0.021050163,-0.051827114,0.03740113,-0.009852151,0.059790026,0.006915216,-0.046793487,-0.010457839,-0.019708287,-0.02302383,-0.02236866,-0.063843384,-0.08002425,0.017841185,0.04512459,-0.07013355,0.03810791,-0.047457278,0.05086348,0.09920075,-0.0040266323,-0.062250927,-0.030195571,0.045890804,0.10445802,0.04233076,0.0046533667,-0.07963403,0.052425247,-0.003509144,0.052485514,-0.0258459,0.027216751,-0.009239261,-0.0073880376,0.003764565,0.055595633,0.07684473,-0.062412545,-0.1181138,-0.10582624,-0.0074823727,-0.04272439,-0.065595776,-0.04232725,-0.044451736,0.057095733,0.03508524,-0.092301846,-0.024985526,-0.06270232,-0.039463684,-0.011327794,-0.0016496179,-0.020306064,0.013257258,-0.0013135958,0.111185886,-0.035880998,0.034769163,0.017671231,0.030881615,0.031973403,-0.021622173,0.0028013452,-0.12215953,0.06826338,-0.0075923037,0.035087854,0.038774304,-0.011697919,0.07635326,-0.036317512,0.012763568,0.054989398,-0.03607301,0.111394614,0.01628035,0.009442531,-0.03577067,-0.020870253,0.020366823,-0.023041891,0.054702565,0.050509665,-0.03981979,0.005787158,0.0071279444,0.011244519,0.035697393,-0.02596474,0.03964908,0.060107343,0.019924195,0.030611584,-0.06770725,-0.046749968,-0.11449779,-0.040353246,0.060304414,0.0293894,-0.015580105,-0.0033956587,-0.0854896,-0.004192809,-0.08635122,0.049432546,-0.007361215,-0.020957068,0.03159832,-0.050187886,-0.052461304,0.040170606,-0.10415522,-0.029230759,0.07415444,0.052656744,0.04524033,0.05294733,-0.079399005,5.8862465e-33,-0.057861287,-0.067887396,0.0051057264,-0.020413725,-0.024138391,-0.062788986,-0.018491857,-0.07351675,0.062125452,0.035370644,-0.038022377,0.07113717,0.0016429008,0.008819927,0.037570525,-0.04453127,0.053442206,0.013425145,-0.033491574,-0.04319999,0.029904976,-0.062246237,0.06783714,0.007947404,0.044477224,0.04152432,0.035324086,0.0066699535,0.07219671,0.03058874,0.025405942,-0.032420386,0.0072851763,0.03494446,-0.0440009,-0.033032354,0.038351156,0.013128378,0.011190426,0.06654964,-0.026103752,-0.00057349,0.057112142,-0.048896477,0.012397001,0.05375837,0.0332034,0.026319109,0.028377885,0.104922086,-0.020647535,-0.02231063,0.031169487,-0.013857205,-0.06086546,0.077054374,-0.041729447,-0.15903217,0.057184935,0.014736221,-0.032393552,0.024964392,-0.016752414,-0.0094554,0.0074357633,0.002854135,0.0091002155,-0.044642255,-0.010718613,-0.00877695,-0.0026552137,-0.06436487,-0.06406516,0.021634692,-0.003014478,-0.04136191,0.0041741165,0.10232768,0.017976543,0.0029607483,0.05646926,0.03896994,-0.009801159,-0.12081353,-0.03705867,-0.014676799,0.06425078,-0.050258495,-0.0224731,0.0067091575,-0.05905233,0.07867443,-0.04312696,0.0005508991,0.09273969,-6.659449e-33,-0.059073586,0.05480906,0.0045247544,0.09252544,0.045651145,0.00015489961,0.005069033,-0.055988323,0.16142973,-0.051459726,-0.04079653,-0.030601552,0.006143496,0.027279869,-0.03393368,0.07741568,-0.041028287,-0.033903707,-0.1055916,0.003482449,0.019297335,0.026079481,-0.052106358,-0.043142494,-0.09680911,0.030457782,-0.059389412,0.01477234,-0.06977247,-0.02873465,0.03689028,-0.08340087,-0.035383813,0.0019955612,-0.05005837,0.019895706,0.06795515,-0.010854808,-0.03781178,0.015995707,0.026192203,0.031890918,-0.046271294,-0.022988996,0.0032379425,0.022930827,-0.001102282,0.07588659,0.030260837,0.053166293,0.036695383,0.02132602,0.0044387584,-0.0070122895,0.03654878,0.030278584,0.14095451,-0.025006725,-0.13141748,0.0705185,0.024521554,-0.033870034,-0.01808681,-0.041566547,-0.025894575,-0.03642273,0.12217546,-0.049249176,-0.0009970124,-0.020529304,-0.006041296,0.024609374,-0.037361626,-0.09893633,0.0459157,-0.03148211,-0.12817818,0.035490293,-0.029098285,-0.019107452,0.039959952,-0.05634342,0.06112474,0.037845727,-0.049083702,0.047923207,0.06847003,-0.084880106,0.021978797,-0.043662574,-0.07608483,-0.01894596,-0.040158205,0.07159201,0.029081773,-5.8245035e-08,0.0038601602,-0.07941973,0.029199816,0.014509384,0.068039656,-0.08881468,-0.04572849,0.14057866,0.04913708,0.020324081,0.044630546,-0.012619065,-0.15149911,0.014929065,0.067304865,-0.047868744,0.0722591,0.09404137,-0.06800089,0.005812129,0.05559469,-0.027396452,-0.001262612,-0.019679964,0.13204962,-0.02240447,-0.008686903,0.035910957,0.02668469,0.009401777,-0.02255594,-0.033270393,0.041926946,0.010097634,0.0043214825,-0.011882165,0.14376529,0.029013393,-0.087570354,-0.018303724,-0.06494041,0.05377754,0.011132468,-0.005010813,0.04868096,0.02565924,-0.010792242,0.014095621,0.03183884,-0.023464954,-0.04433909,-0.014844035,0.023533456,0.06111804,0.0038176633,0.027988622,0.021206394,-0.012703079,-0.005403744,-0.0372191,0.07110395,-0.049180705,-0.100263774,-0.006937725,4,6.2010684,27.587963,6
75,"1. we started off with the exploratory data analysis, the ability to visualise given data and analyse its various patterns based on various histogram, and plots.
2. main factors for solving a machine learning problem include domain knowledge, communication and critical thinking about problem
3. sources of data, lot of anamolies and real world data isnâ€™t close to the pre processed easy to handle data
4. got to know about crisp: cross industry process for data mining. data understanding: eda, data preperation: selecting, cleaning, construction and formatting
5. importance of hypothesis testing, the two tests that checks whether the errors follow normal distribution or not
6. talked about the data mind map consisting various problems with major branches like dependent variable and independent variable
and various problems such as column problem, heteroscelasticity, across the column problems, insuffuficent features.
7. talked about various methods to remove anamolies, one being feeding in the value of mean or the value obtained by fitting a curve, it can be the value of k nearest beighbour
8. talked about pca, about projection of higher dimensional data into a 2d plane to detect various outliers.",0.0006698594,-0.009718625,0.01192205,-0.030543592,-0.0112980055,-0.07471394,-9.662917e-05,0.01790428,-0.078802384,0.11056323,-0.020296099,0.03206801,0.002719646,0.004527111,-0.02209451,0.0043486115,0.013340073,-1.6350139e-05,-0.08406752,-0.06388861,0.03087134,-0.0006099675,-0.06388197,0.07321681,-0.06354588,-0.0017673093,0.1007871,-0.0144935325,-0.083137445,-0.0073153004,-0.006301557,0.068729185,0.013952189,-0.012051457,0.004917111,0.035810973,-0.0008946842,0.09253226,0.047945857,0.008791142,-0.013214615,-0.059856325,-0.042489577,0.007168773,0.07841558,0.009458253,-0.07968436,-0.119569264,-0.009153918,-0.023711419,-0.10445126,-0.06612684,-0.02452021,-0.009034357,0.022204205,-0.088078216,-0.02691122,-0.08230293,0.06589788,0.0013278159,0.010497239,-0.06749302,-0.014871939,-0.041772958,0.062388897,-0.052045625,0.035461806,0.06448452,0.009880206,-0.017713154,-0.017090077,0.083066024,-0.080029525,0.024243258,-0.008805827,0.05548808,-0.010155382,-0.03415111,0.044387136,-0.07467258,0.048910975,0.099186696,-0.015530671,0.039071366,0.04194864,-0.014561734,-0.036931567,-0.008454893,-0.029022047,-0.00045019665,0.08094847,0.03237488,0.014401737,-0.010551044,0.053747807,0.048359495,0.01693377,-0.07135148,0.08605346,0.054040406,0.0029594358,0.055084966,0.022854012,0.0039715534,-0.03244064,-0.032079466,0.02345862,0.009535077,0.033373818,-0.02758157,-0.10863829,0.0013781555,-0.057070512,-0.03719369,0.039429568,-0.021038225,0.0040756315,0.034422096,-0.06621705,0.03789024,-0.06433454,0.003300604,0.02655836,0.045507796,0.07526939,-0.03007273,-0.10726842,1.0229794e-32,0.020398473,0.017476154,-0.046203915,0.035249133,0.021305583,-0.082883924,-0.021963723,-0.025313124,0.1087293,0.062591225,-0.009120614,0.08557262,0.015618303,-0.0021325974,0.03803899,0.010515018,0.039416015,0.001198197,-0.09106949,-0.013591098,0.024030318,-0.14367916,0.08682138,0.0015892618,0.021235477,0.036421772,-0.020446401,-0.03275049,0.009119574,0.011029893,0.010802954,0.008099128,-0.075517,0.09722648,-0.039475497,-0.048906527,0.0012038106,-0.034913827,0.023687983,0.07301902,-0.059675433,0.034228463,0.048278578,0.0003501879,0.043674782,0.07786229,0.025578612,-0.017406693,0.055320702,0.003748345,0.034671016,-0.048329014,0.01899054,-0.047506258,-0.04848814,0.09698294,0.008234402,-0.16094576,0.07577446,0.0530617,-0.013389351,-0.0034228987,0.0047112713,0.008121764,-0.026415374,-0.04772187,-0.0074466937,0.03531754,0.037150297,-0.005577334,-0.023521729,-0.00041586757,-0.015109613,-0.01669275,0.049952276,0.03437728,-0.005183924,0.024487337,-0.050105084,0.011577605,0.01247017,0.0036879727,0.0004217542,-0.14829391,-0.021253545,-0.056115925,0.039667092,-0.028245384,-0.011661377,-0.026283935,-0.058406934,0.07347602,-0.053692296,0.05312126,0.023156088,-7.892925e-33,-0.050006,0.06463559,-0.021795338,0.06955232,-0.001731722,0.04240741,-0.026649646,0.0007155833,0.045921136,-0.045354705,-0.064333886,-0.029739467,0.051987432,0.045058563,0.004507731,0.03866716,0.00077399705,-0.037661407,-0.06533129,0.001435359,-0.050803013,0.036316786,-0.15676822,-0.06017108,-0.033725034,0.04981406,-0.0914182,-0.04659151,-0.03277433,0.0271883,-0.048615064,0.0061418433,-0.019745925,0.031541597,-0.037967913,-0.006345537,0.047295813,-0.09220622,0.016450917,0.051858023,0.0443358,0.119439,-0.047318537,-0.05036583,-0.051842697,-0.028321715,-0.0011993034,0.047699425,0.06357499,0.03933454,0.056645893,0.052092217,0.044551525,-0.039971113,0.008900341,0.0495714,0.054456566,-0.0003223261,-0.05417604,0.06219505,0.016492402,-0.031676333,0.049537815,0.045269072,-0.019822324,-0.0097892415,0.03940847,0.015687663,-0.020611057,-0.03683215,-0.068258464,0.037341453,-0.03632976,-0.038959835,0.0081490325,-0.026544858,-0.031371135,-0.036639664,-0.0068392856,0.060926575,0.04612907,-0.08104633,0.017788539,0.07870307,0.004816201,0.08251434,0.07880557,-0.059995532,0.010728029,-0.11879593,-0.07197824,-0.026160572,-0.079487815,0.121412866,0.06595348,-6.621726e-08,-0.065558225,-0.09593468,0.060035143,-0.060708042,0.09941216,-0.049298897,-0.052748896,0.19430976,-0.021561135,-0.010573668,0.025569975,-0.011078332,-0.11703358,0.012909769,0.06515715,-0.007635271,0.05310284,0.053328298,-0.053106192,-0.010711799,0.077235945,-0.0027869935,-0.016544547,-0.00044521687,0.06112551,-0.08100411,-0.0027510372,0.03408966,-0.028880596,0.0026023486,-0.03235426,-0.047893986,0.07894985,-0.025253333,0.042393755,0.067879975,0.111927144,-0.015030755,-0.085099265,0.036212213,-0.013655108,0.0685008,-0.030872414,0.011840731,0.038933393,-0.005651564,0.027251275,-0.052307863,0.045473844,-0.042638518,0.016933149,0.02984126,0.07071411,0.046718597,0.04484422,0.07557871,0.0109681375,0.018709641,-0.019571401,0.030677069,0.05836402,-0.004278202,-0.03292211,0.028929688,4,5.536382,31.81149,6
101,"we started with discussing confusion matrix for multi class (before this, understand the meaning ascribed to rows and columns). in the midsem, there won't be derivations, it will include understanding the problem (then eda, visualisations). then we discussed crisp-dm (cross industry standard process for data mining) - 6 steps that run cyclically - business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. then ta discussed outliers and quartiles in boxplots. then we discussed missing values (mcar, mar and mnar). for handling missing

109,"approach to solving the midsem question paper
to systematically analyze the given problem, we followed a structured approach, starting with exploratory data analysis (eda). this involved examining the dataset for missing values, identifying key statistical measures such as the range, mean, median, 25th and 75th percentiles, and count, and understanding the overall distribution of the data.

upon detecting missing values, we explored various imputation strategies. given that the number of missing values was small, we opted to drop them. however, alternative approaches such as replacing them with the mean, median, or using linear interpolation could also be employed in other scenarios.

since the dataset primarily contained categorical features, we aimed to build a prediction model to classify ailments based on blood test results. to assess the interdependence among the features, we applied principal component analysis (pca) and visualized correlations using a heatmap of pairwise components. while the heatmap did not indicate significant correlation, it only accounted for pairwise relationships. to check for multicollinearity among multiple features, we computed the variance inflation factor (vif) by fitting regression models for each feature against all others and analyzing the râ² values.

given the presence of outliers and the nature of the data, we chose a tree-based model, specifically random forest, due to its robustness in handling non-linearity and outliers. since the dataset exhibited a large difference between minimum and maximum values, we applied normalization before feeding it into the model.

further analysis of the frequency distribution of categorical values revealed a significant class imbalance, with the heart disease class being heavily underrepresented. as expected, this imbalance led to poor classification performance, as reflected in the confusion matrix.

to validate our modelâ€™s generalizability, we applied the same analysis to another dataset. the results showed that the model did not fit well, suggesting that the two datasets were likely drawn from different underlying populations.

through this systematic process, we were able to derive key insights about data preprocessing, feature relationships, and model performance, emphasizing the importance of handling missing values, normalization, and addressing class imbalances in classification tasks.",0.027707748,-0.018555414,0.051984537,0.06366135,0.059805393,0.044214863,-0.0453625,0.05258958,-0.013283991,-0.02815394,0.010684016,-0.08472156,-0.044381045,0.042608444,-0.002454857,0.0076109474,-0.006753809,-0.0026769384,-0.085376,-0.035706718,-0.013682322,0.08512814,-0.01843724,0.057399966,0.039925132,0.028577907,0.015077493,-0.0018522855,-0.08090319,0.10368258,0.015780944,-0.004036267,0.017776722,0.034183696,-0.06605424,-0.038160317,0.029193288,0.04314203,-0.09396007,0.0070917625,0.0063254233,-0.020857198,0.020041555,0.026067387,0.108937874,0.03512495,-0.065899506,-0.055073664,-0.013785435,0.044999897,-0.048996404,0.0023373356,-0.041491263,0.11874885,0.008246871,-0.079735555,-0.060426172,-0.10008372,-0.025632624,0.010189231,-0.06627809,-0.010010835,0.030681457,0.03541072,0.039739117,0.017882952,0.032888148,0.008478205,-0.060760844,0.037545,-0.054925222,-0.008121361,-0.083249785,0.07625218,-0.018488713,0.09147103,0.017488545,0.010729831,0.028923841,-0.040121607,-0.00097527,0.08820836,-0.0028235668,0.043482948,0.077560045,0.021783711,0.049884252,0.017564548,-0.16818391,0.028431853,0.025585324,0.03670604,0.014325272,0.0016507705,0.057586323,0.09637701,0.03188663,-0.10582063,0.035800442,0.021830615,-0.058049127,-0.019514697,-0.004563606,-0.024772443,-0.031776804,-0.043177504,0.04814713,-0.016832137,0.024276277,0.035562363,0.0034302415,-0.0612469,-0.004015643,-0.04559162,0.10033407,-0.06040781,0.03174371,0.012638811,0.10055707,0.07021531,-0.058292374,0.0031744158,0.09896119,0.058298897,0.091816425,0.06081315,-0.0634997,4.7133973e-33,0.05033136,-0.07802385,0.074388936,0.032144412,0.015758002,-0.02386114,-0.045278493,0.007838438,0.08832267,0.02100083,-0.011230909,0.054426618,-0.007110587,0.039066643,-0.041874114,0.047356788,0.032719012,-0.020638527,-0.0535876,0.061204504,-0.026022771,-0.03216871,0.032455985,-0.0332428,-0.037383277,0.012943066,-0.029017562,-0.015359301,-0.027950622,-0.007038593,-0.09512823,0.015406427,-0.022719229,-0.0208661,-0.11164223,-0.03944813,0.066056825,-0.006507782,0.038290843,0.025009116,-0.0020252313,-0.028410053,-0.011956283,-0.022680724,0.01615311,0.004992682,0.07547044,-0.039029844,-0.026263714,0.0046008076,-0.012171634,0.0013819379,0.030497348,-0.04889926,-0.11929969,0.06143358,-0.08602304,-0.050282218,-0.03299476,-0.011445678,-0.018658394,0.08752879,-0.0045994534,-0.026561884,-0.029506333,-0.058951404,-0.029282069,0.0063740937,0.0017127742,-0.014729617,0.021893188,-0.04313981,-0.02068915,-0.012195731,0.02523033,0.02835355,-0.01853194,-0.015426591,-0.031340167,-0.019750955,0.069323584,-0.017283287,0.08102709,-0.013800668,0.025798487,-0.034157827,0.03486448,-0.086096354,-0.05048388,-0.11485843,-0.12029145,0.0358164,0.0047810413,0.023765786,0.046491835,-5.258902e-33,-0.01684747,0.057412747,0.015107465,0.08429086,0.057519205,-0.041392393,0.010267132,-0.0236687,0.08079757,-0.04362542,0.095509805,-0.09370117,0.05781308,0.008224377,0.009522782,0.080342874,-0.120006256,-0.005117651,0.036277648,0.030483907,-0.0074243187,0.050802544,-0.025501044,0.008700285,-0.10796763,0.03205875,-0.01974447,-0.07516405,-0.07677322,-0.1236324,-0.014614503,0.0026921069,-0.024238134,-0.073416896,-0.07072515,0.015564833,0.004513081,-0.106662415,-0.07199064,0.048365124,0.10851632,0.044468865,-0.10132295,-0.0048109125,-0.023318917,-0.0061208797,0.043102514,0.061959103,0.0628644,0.064990774,-0.025069894,-0.033754386,-0.056290317,0.05463521,0.044262156,-0.040010534,0.024895974,-9.2833017e-07,-0.067443505,0.0030299688,-0.033088174,-0.020735566,0.02465552,-0.042321865,0.07445953,-0.004716962,0.078842305,-0.03669876,-0.012758218,-0.03161063,0.013103457,0.015457381,-0.017181795,-0.09733224,0.0692672,0.0013540001,-0.033347163,-0.07551078,-0.03905364,0.014120133,0.059027113,-0.13955969,-0.01784916,0.044400703,-0.07068737,0.035881035,0.026440987,-0.021305634,0.019108534,-0.023799704,-0.06397763,0.051080458,-0.031597078,0.057775408,-0.04376761,-5.5166815e-08,0.06880694,0.033589173,-0.06953995,0.013438239,-0.008967821,-0.069985576,-0.022908313,0.10394275,0.020941861,0.038205855,0.073790215,-0.031837113,-0.091696,0.031339187,0.050169446,-0.028678222,0.07806173,0.021613419,0.0017026796,0.016836006,0.056870833,-0.020358134,0.009068532,0.013208214,0.09330527,-0.037713565,0.008719021,0.03210954,0.02639399,0.07373505,-0.04604668,-0.044216797,-0.027523352,-0.018381925,-0.008579259,0.028567614,0.1085289,-0.02124412,-0.085255206,-0.040402725,-0.038929008,0.022072347,-0.034911573,-0.010534652,0.041490372,-0.058222648,0.026952695,-0.011379993,0.07270697,-0.073702514,-0.0315144,-0.03563142,0.04763559,0.11437205,0.029779494,0.016080147,0.027889973,0.07014933,0.041360587,-0.03545534,0.07599131,-0.03792498,-0.050460994,-0.011740561,14,10.805072,22.569378,6
141,"we discussed about how different methods represent the confusion matrix of the logistic regression, we can know columns by either going through the documentation of the particular python library or use the support values and the dataset columns. we looked the method data scientist's have come up with to work with the data, that is crisp-dm cross industry standard process for data mining there are six steps in this business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation and deployment
in these data understanding and preparation are the key aspects. we learnt how important it is to do eda. we saw a mind map about what to do when we have different issues with the data mainly the problems are related to the data y and x values. we saw what techniques are used to tackle these problems like if there is class imbalance in dataset of classification problem etc. we looked the different eda methods like doing hypothesis, using box-plots to know the outliers , using heat maps to know the corelation among different features , matrix plot from this we can we get to know some nice clusters which are forming among the features together and their corelation with each other the problem is they give corelation between only two features at a time. next we saw about the missing values one there are three kinds of missing values mcar-missing completely at random, mar-missing at random(one of the sensor is faulty), mnar-missing not at random(like the co sensor is not designed to calculate the concentrations above 110). we can handle these through replacing the missing values using mean, median or mode where ever possible here is where the distribution of the particular feature is important to fill the missing values, we can also use ml model to particular feature to fill the missing values , backward and forward filling and interpolation techniques. outliers-finding can be done using iqr, probability of the data point lying within the 3 standard deviations from the mean of the feature, db scan for multivariate, we can also use t-sne plot to visualise the obtained outlier points of n-dimensions by projecting it on 2d plane. outlier-handling, dropping the column or row, data capping replacing outlier values with iqr upper and lower bounds is an example. if an outlier is true we can isolate it and treat it separately. mean if influenced by outliers but median is

147,"data preprocessing & handling missing data
filling missing data:
use ml models like regression.
fill gaps using forward/backward methods.
fill based on column data distribution.

finding outliers:
use probability and standard deviation.
use boxplots to detect unusual values.
dbscan method helps in detecting outliers.
outliers affect the mean but not the median.

handling outliers:
dropping: remove extreme values.
capping: replace outliers with upper/lower limits.
isolating: keep outliers separate for analysis.
exploratory data analysis (eda) & visualization
matrix plot: shows feature distributions and clusters.
box plot: helps find outliers.
pair plot: shows how features are related.
crisp-dm framework (data mining process)

steps
1. business understanding â€“ know the problem and goal.
2. data understanding â€“ explore the data.
3. data preparation â€“ clean and organize the data.


4. modeling â€“ build predictive models.


5. evaluation â€“ test and check model performance.


6. deployment â€“ use the model in real-world scenarios.





the process runs in cycles, meaning steps are repeated.

setting deadlines is important to avoid endless improvements.

167,"the session started with a recap of the mid-semester exam, emphasizing problem-solving strategies and methods to address various kinds of questions efficiently. this served to reinforce important concepts and enhance analytical thinking for similar problems in the future.

next, the discussion covered the primary steps involved in exploratory data analysis (eda). this included data visualization techniques such as histograms and heat maps, which help in understanding data distributions and correlations. additionally, handling missing values was discussed, emphasizing methods like imputation or dropping missing data based on context.

one of the major challenges with the dataset was the under-sampling of the target class, ""heart diseases."" imbalance in this form can severely influence prediction accuracy, causing the model to become biased. the drawback of using an imbalanced dataset was discussed, as well as possible remedies in the form of resampling techniques or utilizing correct evaluation measures like precision-recall curves.

feature transformation and selection were also investigated. the conditions under which columns were to be dropped were described, such as when features were highly collinear or had minimal variance. feature scaling was highlighted as important, especially for models that are sensitive to feature magnitude, like support vector machines (svm) and logistic regression.

model selection was informed by data type and problem. tree models, svm, and logistic regression were the contenders as viable candidates. the pros and cons of each model were assessed based on the characteristics of the dataset, making an informed decision.

lastly, the curse of dimensionality was discussed, meaning the issues that arise from dealing with high-dimensional data, including overfitting and higher computational costs. the variance inflation factor (vif) was identified as a metric for the detection of multicollinearity to assist in feature selection and enhancing model performance.",0.00096367666,0.06943648,0.011635958,0.040932532,0.05992737,-0.003751253,-0.017582722,0.035178214,-0.05500612,-0.04527956,-0.017695148,-0.010114696,0.031277265,-0.0067045726,0.0024683573,-0.07342206,-0.012854784,0.007262919,-0.10356786,-0.015230923,-0.023251757,0.04448166,-0.054109044,0.06159904,-0.022420203,-0.012426677,0.0049676425,-0.07841397,-0.058500346,0.016636515,0.02051719,0.03204697,0.011135123,0.038369354,-0.09509773,0.010335687,0.0472878,0.109078206,-0.10748624,0.03329235,-0.03175005,-0.044622883,0.0067670094,0.093894415,0.069589324,-0.025089566,-0.09273381,-0.049558543,0.026830127,0.05826378,-0.082816936,-0.032576054,-0.050491154,0.05871765,-0.051051334,-0.05327349,-0.0039243572,-0.041261822,-0.040490314,0.02318495,-0.048973497,-0.038825646,0.0039101113,0.053849332,-0.04705751,-0.06562646,0.06572925,-0.019064376,0.063664466,0.057740256,-0.0054358477,0.010866041,-0.048810247,0.058816817,0.019446304,0.09753193,-0.0021829172,-0.0023875707,0.07306615,0.035442308,-0.01960657,0.005816354,-0.017664503,0.022389686,0.06423307,0.005558354,-0.020436386,-0.021207953,-0.06714742,0.023355078,0.050118614,-0.018170403,0.0240581,0.056069102,0.060269926,0.081089996,0.018855173,-0.023352409,0.013473979,0.058566675,-0.0035116002,0.037970074,-0.011388928,-0.0036623485,-0.054768387,-0.12988995,0.08503038,-0.059771,0.0033845124,-0.05280398,0.010482132,-0.007655926,0.009928349,-0.04495459,0.07295366,-0.022670202,-0.003220112,-0.028233552,-0.08684772,0.120695755,-0.027234802,0.025721211,0.038722686,0.0061894036,0.051982027,0.0072481614,-0.11002987,4.3042853e-33,0.027199622,-0.009394431,0.029781513,0.039645765,0.03224312,-0.06356199,-0.05174258,0.0043771346,0.03648855,0.034988537,0.0018442249,0.06629809,0.019708844,0.06985823,-0.007633742,0.03741322,-0.06513852,0.09077553,-0.06337057,0.04744268,-0.023044366,-0.109620035,0.025557313,-0.02494394,-0.039312556,0.12410964,-0.07845403,0.03306509,0.00526936,0.008250592,-0.06687121,-0.002360688,-0.05211936,-0.032924954,-0.025738034,-0.012363141,0.09249675,0.0059444048,0.033918615,0.052537825,0.016449025,0.01774313,0.027247652,-0.008915715,-0.0016807308,0.01145908,0.11372484,-0.10328793,-0.017105743,0.010398865,-0.015026015,-0.051428497,-0.000752925,-0.057886623,-0.07087135,0.08306622,-0.0033960352,-0.04263414,-0.029770099,-0.010946165,-0.03539593,0.0721496,0.0020147667,-0.0026521496,-0.06799015,-0.05434517,-0.03634097,-0.06196841,-0.004560006,-0.022382727,-0.00046260224,-0.042175144,-0.08540232,0.031408004,0.04660391,0.032824118,0.018346328,0.056399506,-0.024777975,0.010999127,0.014569865,-0.03484637,0.0169252,-0.090754524,-0.021495286,-0.016370278,0.073282875,-0.06482219,-0.050657775,-0.041643277,-0.06426735,0.047306966,-0.0381108,0.001333732,0.037062194,-5.057997e-33,-0.063634805,0.079544775,-0.039840564,0.0075693666,0.03783969,0.0033819785,0.02854045,0.004257904,0.07813308,-0.05537062,0.020305658,-0.089557916,0.009748457,0.005199484,-0.07328313,0.042996906,-0.10904042,-0.057873867,-0.05687144,0.01622209,-0.0089261215,0.02558724,-0.03845992,0.02083839,-0.08189484,0.035272587,-0.02944603,-0.08317927,-0.0009289677,-0.15140589,0.005625526,-0.07912569,-0.017798519,-0.0025564658,-0.040694535,0.03267794,0.039495263,-0.040244464,0.0037345146,0.09259949,0.11698272,0.091231674,-0.0837269,0.02500782,-0.03410285,-0.027946603,0.045590006,0.04268914,0.08455511,0.05521258,-0.0034872124,0.014470608,-0.025369015,0.05493132,0.029989066,-0.017013624,0.04333793,-0.009004494,-0.09649668,0.099781424,-0.05355003,-0.0381044,0.008099801,-0.09174995,0.012257943,-0.012814911,0.04279765,0.035124555,-0.01875972,0.043646377,-0.024898838,0.04312942,0.0072782044,-0.07878199,0.07253823,-0.05626123,-0.019766748,-0.017498437,-0.055303648,-0.032106303,0.021723537,-0.08131419,-0.02632241,0.08098952,-0.02467333,0.079735026,0.08675291,-0.03335078,0.01823699,0.00053885573,-0.08631779,0.03515308,-0.012703453,0.10930282,-0.015547645,-5.8288013e-08,5.523051e-05,0.056922227,0.011380542,0.037406173,-0.02685113,-0.07101702,-0.07967665,0.13349952,-0.052502654,0.03198456,0.05505845,0.0039271177,-0.073628314,0.013702031,0.09795103,-0.03043117,0.07816181,0.098901585,-0.0121349525,-0.0013632043,0.06075456,-0.054767344,-0.043636702,0.014276046,0.08587007,-0.031823736,0.030688964,0.09742757,0.0055794227,-0.024302313,-0.0732353,0.025044512,-0.00834262,-0.0035267835,0.015236131,-0.044304598,0.09079876,-0.02840616,-0.08277804,0.056825735,-0.0262435,0.059868306,0.012034483,0.018755715,-0.0022616717,0.008773955,-0.018642884,0.026353963,0.08402704,-0.048404135,-0.0100784525,0.018379055,0.053897984,0.062712505,0.020864712,0.06765708,0.011484116,0.05707922,-0.037032418,0.011077707,0.054648794,0.01606542,-0.124749996,0.026994549,4,9.94,24.49148,6
178,"today, we started the class with the importance of domain knowledge, common sense so that we can detect that what is wrong in the data, what are the outliers. sometimes we encounter data which is mathematically possible but has no physical significance. in such cases, having the domain knowledge is very critical. we learnt about some industry processes for data mining. we came to know that how

183,"the class started off with the realisation that till now, we were working with good tailored data without any issues. however in real life, we almost never get any such data without any problems. much of the real life data has a lot of problems which need to be understood in order to solve the problems in the data and get some meaningful results. for this, we perform eda or exploratory data analysis on our data. our data could come in various formats like text, some files or some databases with large amounts of data present, and we might be exposed to non-tabular and non-numeric data. so we started off with a process for data mining, known as crisp - dm i.e. cross industry standard process for data mining. it has 6 steps which run cyclically, which includes business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation and deployment of the model. business understanding involves defining business objectives, assess situations based on domain knowledge and understand the goals of the firm, while also understanding the constraints. also understand the success criteria and create a project plan as to how much time to allocate to different procedures. 
the major steps which we were focusing on were data understanding and data preparation. data understanding involves collection of data, describe and explore the data and also verify the quality of data which you have collected as to whether it has some useful insights to give or not. data preparation involves selection and cleaning of the data and construct the data into that which is good to work on. we further moved on to eda, which is a part of the data understanding step. 
eda involves performing some initial investigations on the data, and to gain some basic insights from it, and to spot anomalies, create and test hypothesis and check our assumptions. eda basically uses mathematical and visual statistical tools. we then went through a mind map pertaining to data problems. problems can be in the dependent or independent variable or both. we could have maybe no data about the dependent variable, or maybe insufficient or incorrect data, or maybe we could have too much data to handle. each of these problems have different solutions which involve sampling or generating data based on some theory. problems with independent variables involve having too many independent variables i.e. having multiple columns and having problems within the columns and also between columns. within columns we could have missing data, some distribution issues, heteroscadasticity i.e. varying variance across the data. between columns, we could have too few or too many features. 
eda is the first step in the data analysis pipeline, where we can get some insights like how features are distributed, what are the outliers, etc. a common eda technique involves plotting histograms and checking the distributions of each variable. then we plot box plots, which show us the amount of variability in the data, where the central line shows us the median value and the box around it shows the variations. anything outside the main boxes may be considered as outliers. we also plot some correlation heat maps to understand correlations between different variables. matrix plot is a 2-feature-each plot plotted in a matrix formation, which are used to find valuable insights, but are limited to two features at a time. some line plots can show some trends in the data, which can be useful to make certain predictions. 
we then moved on to handling missing values. there are multiple types of missing data. mcar - missing completely at random, mar - missing at random or mnar - missing not at random. mcar has completely random data points missing, mar has some relationship between the missing data points which could be due to resource, method of measurement, etc. mnar says that unobserved values are itself responsible for the data being missing. now when we have identified missing data, we could maybe ignore these missing points. but many algorithms donâ€™t know how to handle missing data, and information may be lost. we could also delete all the missing values, which could lead to data loss, but it is the easiest to do. another option could be to replace the missing values with some data statistic like the mean or the median. mode could be used for categorical data. sometimes instead of the data mean, we could use some of the values close to the missing data point in order to fill the place. we also have multi variate approaches, where we observe the other columns as well in order to fill our missing value. knn takes the mean of the nearest neighbour and fits the mean of the neighbouring values, while mice fits a linear predictor in order to fill in values based on a trend. time series data is special because we can use temporal judgement to fill the data. we can use interpolation methods to fill in points or use simple moving averages as well. 
we then talked about outliers which are data points that are signifcantly different from the rest of the observations. some algorithms are not very sensitive to outliers, while some are quite sensitive. we discussed about quartiles and the inter quartile range, which can be used to detect outliers. standard deviation can also be used for normally distributed data, where any data point beyond 3 standard deviations from the mean, can be classified as an outlier. for multi variate data, we have dbscan which is density based spatial clustering of applications with noise, where outliers are points which are not classified into any broad clusters of high density points. outliers also can be dealt with in many ways like removing them from the dataset, etc. true outliers are data points which are extreme values but they are not erreneous. for such outliers, we could make a separate set out of these and deal with the normal observations and the outliers separately.  for outliers, we use the median and not the mean as the mean is influenced by the outliers, while the median is not. also, for calculating the median, we sort the data first so that we get the correct metric. 
not all techniques are useful for all kinds of data. hence domain knowledge becomes important so as to know what techniques are best for us.

186,"todays session started with the summary comparision and heat map where one summary was completely different than the others and it was found out that it was another class's summary. from this we conclude that we can catch malpractises by simply looking at the data. then sir taught the confusion matrix a tool that evaluates classification models by presenting actual and predicted values in a two-way matrix. it was followed by eda. business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, assessment, and deployment are the six essential phases that make up exploratory data analysis (eda).
ta named shubham used visualizations to show a diabetes prediction model during an eda session. . regression, multivariate data imputation, replacing by mean/median , and deleting  were the methods discussed for dealing with missing data.

193,"he session focused on real-world data challenges and the significance of exploratory data analysis (eda). the crisp-dm process was emphasized, particularly the stages of data understanding and preparation. eda plays a crucial role in uncovering insights, detecting anomalies, and testing hypotheses.

common issues with independent variables, such as an excessive number of features or missing data, were examined. various eda techniques, including histograms, box plots, and heatmaps, were utilized to visualize data distributions, variability, and correlations.

different approaches to handling missing valuesâ€”categorized as mcar, mar, and mnarâ€”were discussed. strategies such as deletion and imputation methods (mean, median, mode, knn, and mice) were explored.

outlier detection methods, including quartiles, iqr, and standard deviation, were analyzed, along with strategies for handling them. the median was highlighted as a reliable measure for outlier analysis. selecting appropriate techniques requires a strong understanding of domain

198,"todayâ€™s session focus mainly on exploratory data analysis but before that we learnt that how to differentiate between actual and predicted values in confusion matrices. crisp-dm which stands for cross industry process for data mining in these 6 steps run cyclically 
1) business understanding in which we do many steps including assessing situation (assumption and constraints), risk.
2)data understanding in these we collect initial data, explore data and also verify data quality. 
3) data preparation in these we select data, clean data, construct data, integrate and format data. after this we can infer which is dependent and independent variables. last three steps involved modelling, evaluation and deployment.
exploratory data analysis is an approach used in statistics and data science to analyze and investigate data sets. it involves statistical graphs and data visualization methods to visually represent the data. next we see that what are the problems associated with dependent and independent variables. in case of dependent variables problems such as not availability(remedy is that use unsupervised learning and create labels), incorrect, insufficient data( it includes very few observations or data imbalances) or too much data. and in  independent variables there can be problems within the column or between the column itself. heteroskedastic is that different variance exists throughout the entire datasets range. further ahead we explore types of missing data in the formats - 
1) missing completely at random 
2) missing at random 
3) missing not at random. so what do we do - 1) let them be n/a 
2) delete all instances with missing values 
3) or replace n/a values with a data statistics like mean or mode. mode value helps in categorical data. and multivariate data imputation can also be done. further we explore outliers which are the data points that differ significantly from the rest of data points. most of the models does not know how to handles this, but there are some models which can tackle this problem. how to detect these outliers we can do these either by univariate or multivariate methods. we calculate quartiles which divide a dataset into four equal parts, providing insights into data distribution. 
 1. first quartile (q1) â€“ 25% (lower quartile) - it represents the 25th percentile.
 2. second quartile (q2) â€“ it represents 50th percentile and median of the entire dataset.
 3. third quartile (q3) â€“ 75% (upper quartile)
 it represents the 75th percentile, meaning 75% of the data falls below this value.
standard deviation methods is similar. in case of multivariate we have dbscan which stands for density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise. next we see that how to handles the outliers we can do these by data trimming and data capping. values that lies in the extremes arenâ€™t erroneous but they are called true outliers. example - stock prices can drastically shoot up or down, extreme weather events. one important note is that means are influenced by the outliers, median are not influenced by outliers. to get median data should be sorted first. combination of univariate columns many results in error.",0.051644627,-0.007090471,-0.06415428,0.03267625,0.024036195,-0.02769622,0.0035256422,0.01780639,-0.06266427,0.018195564,0.044677585,0.04059615,0.025244918,0.012154156,-0.0068097794,0.0026700033,0.006682626,-0.008275552,-0.08577607,-0.06915979,0.0054727476,-0.019586673,-0.059735026,0.019513212,-0.014743846,0.024110464,0.036612973,0.035147518,-0.019859817,-0.020804586,0.0063799373,0.06050853,-0.001906865,-0.016597318,-0.007844968,0.027840655,-0.01489418,0.08405254,-0.015690772,0.015969675,-0.06503012,-0.044487327,-0.054448575,0.003801638,0.04653694,-0.02804985,-0.048824344,-0.051583614,-0.08035205,0.026596576,-0.095836766,-0.0071273786,0.040420827,-0.041877713,0.053195048,-0.061349843,-0.047514047,-0.015936555,-0.0025390675,-0.0016348228,0.05051742,-0.068873174,-0.011879549,0.005155745,0.006446618,-0.028134182,0.04404742,0.013652818,-0.02234007,0.011508034,-0.03020118,0.0013073615,-0.122454725,-0.0013601301,-0.07888402,0.07814513,0.049796406,-0.026528431,0.056394648,-0.04404698,0.04769119,0.12736943,-0.08542676,0.07338471,0.027927104,-0.059435546,0.03775035,0.022574186,-0.06716786,0.04463267,0.06025919,0.01664044,-0.019429365,0.010076058,0.027845846,0.041372642,0.012220675,-0.061493564,0.0737774,0.032378815,0.028515102,0.05806605,0.03166397,0.010659341,-0.106046736,-0.09988061,0.034976505,0.0215197,-0.019660335,0.006307227,-0.0014047482,-0.0067463703,-0.061161973,-0.062325243,0.04974031,-0.043114588,-0.039984237,-0.030136386,-0.03308486,0.06812327,-0.012610634,-0.0025395073,0.08668872,0.029768724,0.043339644,-0.019063827,-0.042844128,7.777708e-33,0.01751141,-0.04171599,-0.06922391,0.071071066,0.05329782,-0.019392066,-0.06366423,-0.024672149,0.003940958,0.069127485,-0.0015484191,0.09562181,-0.012784417,0.032039758,0.062387,0.028299842,0.015659729,0.106915675,-0.032113817,-0.007127424,0.03276132,-0.10824794,0.033861432,0.008120848,0.09761434,0.03329292,0.026956057,0.039014604,0.039883792,0.011398172,0.06371198,0.01052914,-0.051979482,0.038242523,-0.029489186,-0.028689353,-0.05378576,-0.043134335,0.046397652,0.033307575,-0.03902137,0.00790839,0.030795546,0.008074353,-0.028720915,0.066720635,0.06255451,-0.05864149,0.04054911,0.0096438145,-0.0035951026,-0.02167818,0.06775549,-0.058450516,-0.017039405,0.10839205,-0.015106755,-0.15406114,-0.001307162,0.022074437,-0.13907865,0.034927938,-0.04372643,-0.012650798,-0.0381533,-0.002860477,0.0028636963,0.033307407,0.03460025,-0.046817105,-0.07867249,-0.03779451,0.005547091,-0.046590455,0.09138187,-0.02680336,0.0010892235,0.009201207,-0.008104565,0.018959818,6.061243e-05,-0.019750906,-0.022344073,-0.06451307,-0.066876866,0.027649619,0.0063231885,-0.005904684,-0.016246744,0.04491865,-0.08419585,0.07485531,-0.05202999,0.008840459,0.07380645,-9.695956e-33,-0.028763687,0.063305885,0.010569873,0.03405057,0.031053888,0.048351053,-0.028576115,-0.018005518,0.037000153,-0.07959811,-0.07085521,-0.066397436,-0.0053883116,0.030142106,-0.06480631,0.054612968,-0.05862154,-0.043647118,-0.07361783,-0.00859555,-0.054888655,0.036746673,-0.07671137,-0.0653722,-0.033491604,0.07909249,-0.07852675,-0.007916954,0.004869131,-0.023050386,-0.026364395,-0.050500117,-0.027303223,0.028437866,-0.035275057,0.015568328,0.050079394,-0.1085364,0.010662138,0.040765688,0.053203955,0.1170661,-0.04201437,-0.0055910656,-0.014449408,-0.040134065,0.021375358,0.0394829,0.03675896,-0.0055870386,0.007480883,0.068033405,-0.023231149,-0.015547057,-0.0064571747,-0.032237764,0.059119575,-0.012940063,-0.17014351,0.10383855,0.014453221,-0.01689179,0.023811594,0.0316836,-0.060934413,-0.041702695,0.07562436,-0.038103756,-0.015000485,-0.032612994,0.0035308755,-0.047238007,-0.04445229,-0.089627616,0.07908129,-0.04206482,-0.07095196,-0.038224485,-0.057109408,0.033960335,0.08668445,-0.0230986,0.044079818,0.081329815,-0.03451679,0.07087931,0.04402856,0.012251264,0.014867564,-0.03347183,-0.110091634,-0.03007318,-0.105952345,0.108686484,0.0077532646,-7.0929225e-08,-0.034711383,-0.004993156,0.08771484,-0.02200744,0.036893327,-0.14238004,0.0059918803,0.12857208,0.0028643128,0.0259342,0.061869826,-0.012289415,-0.17018127,0.019227728,0.046721634,0.008777026,0.039009966,0.014417038,-0.018859366,0.018225,0.023169132,-0.026927076,-0.07940499,0.037653644,0.07673588,-0.076782964,0.006789091,0.099833086,0.026590472,-0.000903786,-0.02552999,-0.008272581,0.06360257,0.018598413,-0.030182756,-0.04718186,0.10459712,-0.032230802,-0.06041074,-0.016163697,-0.05518878,0.101006635,-0.017165933,0.046515614,-0.021446874,0.03603914,-0.07971448,-0.022672283,-0.011296518,-0.05385769,-0.01377441,0.0051143337,0.06014538,0.09983944,0.06168401,0.07983269,0.0050849123,0.021680498,0.01935272,0.055270307,-0.03789001,-0.031300917,-0.07116455,-0.06284563,4,4.079084,30.708702,6
211,"how to deal with bad data? crispdm asa a cyclical processes to deal with bad data sets. business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation and deployment are the six strps involved in crispdm. missing values, outliers, heteroscadiscity and deviation from assumed distribution are bad data points in a coloumn. too many featured, too few features, feature scaling problems. 

a few observations were made about the features in pima indian diabetes dataset with box distribution, histograms, heat maps, and scatter plots.
in a pollutants dataset, three types of missing values were taught. missing compmetely at random, missing at random and missing not at random. 

dbscan is a clustering method is similar to kmeans clustering and hierarchial clustering. a case of a few outliers lying on the border of the protection of a features using 2dtsne was seen. dealing with outliers changes with the domain from which the data/feature belongs.

hw: why is median preffered over mean when identifying outliers?

caution! not every eda methods needs yo be applied on every dataset.",0.022590132,-0.013400525,0.04971902,0.028204566,-0.01771374,-0.05166397,-0.020042531,0.044131592,-0.038252167,0.04104518,0.0033692706,0.02555413,0.09551124,-0.073030785,-0.0654259,-0.08103089,0.039999813,-0.06144497,-0.058894258,-0.023969466,-0.018697182,0.05968583,-0.025947418,0.07532435,-0.01565428,-0.020444226,0.060175978,-0.087419964,-0.050395828,-0.0073270146,-0.036315788,0.11825436,-0.00021983674,0.003382101,-0.040628716,0.027989836,0.020061495,0.038968246,-0.039382674,-0.0379233,0.043663617,-0.025626421,-0.029317036,0.063795686,0.0072382833,-0.064327754,-0.054310277,-0.06362376,-0.002462692,-0.064237334,-0.043214623,-0.025328482,-0.039499648,0.05913469,0.04431662,-0.031119242,-0.03729097,0.009700964,0.057738263,-0.011127305,0.0026410292,-0.009106911,0.01864911,-0.020490922,0.10023543,-0.01702576,0.07272748,0.014048277,0.070770435,0.0084486725,0.01967657,0.06933161,-0.042545073,0.061242446,-0.0045399605,0.03048382,-0.006125699,-0.028815119,0.030745529,-0.020726394,0.055151124,0.07238694,0.009504258,0.003018128,0.07972317,0.0049939095,0.040452216,-0.04022931,-0.015828716,-0.034394134,0.03956355,0.0713862,-0.018369058,-0.02211273,-0.011740512,-0.014965074,0.05126611,-0.051419556,0.08113128,0.06837586,0.03231206,-0.004940316,-0.052175056,-0.033169534,-0.011620071,-0.06597846,0.08690135,-0.016190577,-0.028026726,0.031215113,-0.016357725,0.031782504,-0.05792596,-0.042753924,-0.03530994,-0.006258029,0.035733156,-0.033872794,-0.08752312,-0.02227292,-0.104416676,-0.031287186,0.061761167,0.023605678,0.040711768,0.07084069,-0.08820808,8.2469054e-33,0.003788456,-0.0015023452,-0.025786128,-0.08567736,-0.07438028,-0.051717732,-0.052412264,-0.0225351,0.07834821,0.007797312,-0.0022559161,0.03020746,0.0037185291,-0.02037775,0.07340391,-0.03323534,0.035704345,0.053970944,-0.057837613,-0.024027092,-0.0068063852,-0.09192383,0.04091569,-0.06608633,-0.05565879,0.024807857,-0.0106107,0.0072045866,0.05369915,0.040226273,-0.0085572405,0.0126304915,0.014268746,0.06779889,-0.044173896,-0.029198844,0.0128521295,-0.025317576,-0.0021680736,-0.0031070532,-0.032068294,0.033686236,-0.01642069,-0.03620529,0.091819696,0.10040585,0.08771713,-0.041337427,-0.01256778,-0.006892358,-0.029341783,-0.04845391,0.06664583,0.057346452,-0.12419566,0.066089794,0.07558688,-0.18099852,0.042408478,0.043153152,-0.049301166,-0.043082714,-0.012525176,-0.03232191,-0.026903113,-0.062154077,0.025788702,0.050393313,-0.00910968,-0.0143788,0.026002089,-0.01787556,-0.05689128,-0.007698653,-0.040374592,-0.017918596,0.03132996,0.09922797,-0.037989065,-0.023579953,0.10371105,-0.035250936,-0.04436151,-0.08166986,-0.0059822164,-0.03171036,0.030048518,-0.014072115,-0.054879867,0.030620318,-0.05212375,0.045815904,-0.0017992806,-0.00260716,0.028156884,-6.804244e-33,-0.08502375,0.057850063,0.0038779713,0.061944418,-0.006992838,-0.018087674,0.004317652,-0.0005622722,0.05358598,-0.11447694,-0.0702268,-0.07128915,0.026446952,-0.044345934,0.019096645,0.037763957,0.0005767293,-0.061052784,-0.013666815,0.008740623,-0.006428383,-0.046542764,-0.14090891,0.03971942,-0.0657522,0.111489266,-0.13390286,0.019205593,-0.033853468,0.005677087,-0.010605957,0.0055229953,-0.043566234,0.025894443,-0.046640947,-0.021997532,0.04836895,-0.004431043,-0.05088301,-0.0058979243,0.020438844,0.0936145,-0.039537244,0.028481109,0.05625727,-0.023746956,0.03852258,0.03557699,-0.008759629,0.053195667,0.028741866,0.0051003597,0.02481307,0.06382423,0.0007418971,0.020452376,0.034969795,0.011086194,-0.0062343893,0.028640892,0.004138284,-0.094178125,-0.047947217,0.04691433,0.025586681,-0.036693044,0.13027547,-0.028806357,-0.032508068,-0.002782337,-0.014290931,0.0016077262,-0.025674885,-0.086385705,0.00805665,-0.0268974,-0.09183316,-0.035476364,-0.021424523,0.03068178,0.029598435,-0.031624947,0.040355973,0.023759296,0.0031356406,0.058720455,0.07322117,-0.07859688,-0.0017964211,-0.018377906,-0.08662408,0.03416231,-0.086637676,0.07043547,-0.019085215,-5.813814e-08,-0.01551641,-0.047191404,-0.009947949,0.020574352,0.0582633,-0.11567359,-0.06772292,0.2061342,0.038836315,-0.023894338,0.0117045175,-0.06852134,-0.09897737,-0.014439422,0.14731942,-0.04345283,0.016776048,0.06926479,-0.0932165,0.03670538,-0.040243737,0.019951165,0.009474821,-0.034094784,0.05840348,0.016147688,0.06289801,0.059253097,0.051936768,-0.02165038,-0.05039692,-0.060329527,0.07720204,0.01835041,-0.009389964,0.097922675,0.08562155,0.04511502,-0.021612005,0.05587465,0.0042061973,0.05618367,0.0253487,0.0005374073,-0.006711991,0.0053701694,0.054108646,0.07831686,0.123645,-0.030615795,-0.037327763,-0.008125121,-0.037736513,0.03494001,0.007645329,-0.025500543,-0.0147353485,0.032810416,0.078930184,-0.0027454055,0.04319766,-0.070570365,-0.079355545,0.047482464,4,9.081349,28.543747,6
293,we started session with discussion of exploring data basically eda (not easy) - problem solving skill and communication skill is also important. data is tabulated in multiple tables and sometimes merge multiple files into one table. data mining standard and rules are there (sop) also we have to see how to deploy model (at the end of sem nearly). when to say model is success : acceptance criteria also when to stop exit criteria. don't use deep learning when need is not there. goal need to be defined what is to be applied regression or clustering. problems with dependent variables and independent variables. correct the data if the data is incorrect or imbalance. modification of data if skewed apply transformations. -statistical problems. also one ta ( a student) explained about eda and a project: 800 datapoints with main issue if person is diabetes or not.. checking their distribution of data. feature correlation and outcomes are also important. different plot like scatter plot and some clusters plot. also different methods used in the project were discussed. univariate and multivariate data discussion. which methods to be used judiciously

295,"we started with the discussion of non ideal data. unlike the data with which we have dealt till now, real life data most of the times contains anomalies like outliners and missing points. to prepare the data we follow a process named, exploratory data analysis (eda). the main idea behind eda is to identify anomalies, formulate and test hypotheses, and validate assumptions.
for visualization we use, histograms, correlation heatmaps,  line plots
to handle missing data we end to go with one of ignoring, deleting missing values or imputation that is calculating them back via some models. 
and lastly looked at outliers and how to deal with them. there are few algorithms using which we can find outliers and then we distinguished between true outliers, which are extreme but valid values, and erroneous outliers. and depending upon what we decide we can either remove them or do a separate analysis.

314,"sir started the class with a heat map of features extracted from summaries and pointed out an outlier which was a segway into data understanding and preparation from raw data. sir discussed the crisp-dm operation procedure for working with data. further discussed exploratory data analysis which is an approach used in stats to analyse and investigate datasets with the goal of summarising their main characteristics and trends. sir then discussed a mind map of the approach over data analysis. one of the tas took over the lecture and explained exploratory data analysis via an example of a sample from adiabatic population. bhaiya started with plotting histograms and box plots to get a gist of data and further discussed matrix plot showing inter feature relations. here it shows correlation between only two features but when a feature depends on more than one other features, this relationship isn't recognised. then a dataset on temperature variation with time was discussed and sir explained how missing data problem can be fixed by following trends from the past. further a ganga water quality database followed by air quality data of powai were discussed to show missing data. methods like using mean, mode of rest of the data in place of missing values can be used to avoid dropping those observations. more sophisticated methods like use of knn, mice, interpolation to determine the missing values. further we moved on to discuss outliers in the dataset by considering a simple linear regression model. here different methods for finding outliers and eliminating them

345,"the session outlined core data science workflows, emphasizing systematic problem-solving through frameworks like crisp-dmâ€”a cyclical process spanning objective clarification, data exploration, preprocessing, model development, validation, and implementation. practical examples illustrated exploratory analysis (e.g., boxplots for outlier detection, addressing skewed class distributions) and challenges like heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance in models). strategies for incomplete data included deletion or basic imputation (mean/median) for isolated gaps, and advanced methods (knn,

352,"we started with a small recap of previous class on confusion matrix for multiple classes. we then started exploratory data analysis where we looked at it's six cyclic steps. 1) business understanding 2) data understanding 3) data preparation 4) modelling 5) evaluation 6) deployment out of which the 2nd and 3rd one were the ones which we dug deeper into. we had a brief discussion on them. then a ta joined us to show an example of this. the problem was to predict if the patient had diabetes. we saw how some parameters lime glucose and bmi had normal distribution and paramaters like insulin and pregnancies had exponential distribution.  we then looked at inter feature relation plots where we also looked at box plots where insulin showed some outliers. then we had discussion on what to do when some of the data is missing. we can either drop it or fill it with parameters like mean or median. when data is clustered, we can fill the missing data with mean/median but when the data follows say a parabolic distribution, filling it with a mean will result in creation of outlier. we can use the closest value instead of using mean which is known as multivariate data imputation. we then had a brief discussion on t-sne plot which helps in visualing higher dimensional data. we then looked at a recent example of nvidia stock fall which might look like an outlier but it's not. we ended our lecture on a note on how median is better than mean when we want to replace missing data because it is not affected by outliers.

356,"in today's session, the professor began by reviewing the mid-semester exam and explaining the approach to solving the given problem. he first covered the primary steps of exploratory data analysis (eda), including how to visualize data, handle missing values, determine appropriate imputation values, and deal with outliers. the professor then discussed the importance of determining whether to normalize or standardize the data.

by reviewing the bar plot of the target variable, we observed that the target for ""heart diseases"" is under-sampled. in this case, if obtaining more data is not possible, we must acknowledge that accurately predicting the target is not feasible. the professor also demonstrated how to extract insights from histograms and heat maps of the features, and how to decide whether we need to drop certain columns, apply feature scaling, or use dimensionality reduction.

he then explained when to use techniques like pca (principal component analysis) or t-sne. the selection of the appropriate method, such as a tree-based model, svm, or logistic regression, depends on the type of data and the problem we are aiming to solve.

curse of dimensionality arises in high-dimensional spaces, causing sparsity, overfitting, and computational inefficiency. vif detects multicollinearity; high vif (>10) indicates predictors are near-linear combinations, causing unstable estimates. while vif addresses redundancy, the curse focuses on feature volume. mitigate vif by removing features or regularization; combat the curse via dimensionality reduction (e.g., pca) or feature selection. both ensure robust models.

360,"as sir discussed, exploratory data analysis (eda) is a crucial step in machine learning, helping to check hypotheses and find patterns. handling missing values depends on column distribution and can be done using interpolation, forward/backward filling, or ml models like regression. sir demonstrated box and matrix plots, which help detect outliers and feature relations. dbscan, as sir explained, clusters data based on neighborhood density. outliers affect the mean but not the median. sir introduced the crisp-dm framework, which guides data mining in six cyclic steps. setting deadlines in ml projects, as sir advised, is essential to avoid endless work.

361,"so in today's session we learnt about eda and how can we gain insights about our data along with the techniques used to solve the problems that exist in our raw data. till now, we've been working on only one excel file containing all the data but in reality we have tons of files with data to work on when we're deailing with real-life problems. then we learnt about how crisp(cross industry standard process for data mining) dm outlines the steps when we're working with real-life projects which includes business and data understanding, preparation, modeling, evaluation and deployment. then we delved into how we actually do eda on our datasets. we use boxplots to check the variability in our data, feature correlation matrix can be used to understand the data, inter-feature correlation can be checked via matrix plots two at a time. class imbalance is also an important aspect of a data as it can severely affect the performance of our model. then, we jumped on how to deal with missing values in our data. trends can be useful in filling up missing values. some ml algorithms can on their own, identify the missing values and deal with it whereas simple models such as linear regression cannot. mar and mnar are two types of missing values in which mnar is tough to deal with. we can either drop the row but doing this for several rows could impact the quantity of data we are working on so we fix it by filling up the missing values by various methods which include replacing the missing values with the columns with data statistics(mean, median or mode) , using knn or mice to solve for missing values or we could use value of last neighbours when we're dealing with a time series data. when dealing with outliers, we use median value (q2) , q1 and q3 in boxplots and define a tolerance value outside of which a data value will be considered an outlier, we could also use column std. deviation and anything outside of  mean +-3 x std.dev will be considered an outlier. dbscan can also be used. while dealing with outliers, median is a good method and mean is not because mean is affected by the outliers and median is

377,"to keep us interested in ds and making models in genera, till now we have been given good/tame data- data without inherent problems. but now we deal with data that has problems associated with it. and fixing them is a big part of data science

in today's session we focused on- data understanding and preparation
we tried to understand what quality of data is?

heteroscedasticity- when variance of errors is not constant

to begin with, one common eda technique is to plot histograms
one more technique is boxplot- helps us visualise outliers, basically what are the variations of the data
feature correlation- by a heat map
matrix plot- to show relations between the features 2 at a time
we should be wary that if a feature is dependent on more than one feature it may not be captured by the matrix plot or through boxplots

while looking at data, we also have to handle class imbalance

by observing past trends i can predict missing values; past data would tell us that the missing value would lie in a narrow band of possibility
there are 3 types of missing data- mcar, mar, mnar
so the question is- how to fix missig data??
-do nothing-  
-drop missing fields-
-inference from mean-
some things to give a thought about?
>> why focus on median rather than mean for detecting outliers: mean is influenced by outliers but the median is not

378,"today's class started with discussing about confusion matrix (which was also discussed in the last class) for multiple classes. after this we started to discuss about the six cyclic steps in exploratory data analysis which includes business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation and deployment where data understanding was discussed briefly. an example was also discussed. the example constituted of how to check whether the person has diabetes or not. for this, we took some metrics about the patients health like glucose level, body mass index, insulin levels and tried to find out their distributions. we tried find some relation between these parameters. we also saw outliers in the case of box plots of insulin. if some data is missing, we can either drop it or replace it with the mean or median, but doing this will not always result in something good. incase of parabolic distribution, replacing may cause an outlier. to avoid this we can use something called as multivariate data imputation where the closest value is chosed. we also looked at an example of an nvidia stock to discuss more about outliers. then we concluded our lecture by saying that median is better than mean when it's comes to replacing that missing data as median is not affected by outliers.",-0.053695247,0.022192743,-0.024818575,-0.010371138,0.019390691,-0.06955249,0.001184694,0.0670639,0.017752366,0.0018507373,0.024949163,0.07203496,0.023826614,-0.016439283,-0.03835381,-0.07661645,0.042033907,-0.024888778,-0.07979202,0.042290896,-0.013704914,0.046308674,-0.024672769,0.08551068,-0.020556178,-0.024257138,-0.0041334988,-0.044474583,-0.053554494,0.0059197126,-0.044633903,0.099494696,0.022418909,0.028262706,-0.099169545,0.02742753,0.08484477,0.11518296,-0.028003063,0.026739933,-0.045470066,-0.020068858,-0.041200846,0.054743756,-0.011678282,-0.0678127,-0.08037878,-0.14539929,0.035255212,0.005935164,-0.12781791,0.009083758,-0.046990447,0.061050598,0.030405466,-0.078676045,-0.093569115,-0.04327665,-0.014239762,-0.024407083,-0.04000321,-0.04472536,0.024590816,0.015863882,0.08028188,-0.03366714,0.06439717,-0.00897486,0.03845704,0.081988834,-0.023222305,0.010917524,-0.08743022,0.0034283167,-0.038320478,0.007252819,0.0031646916,-0.03227839,-0.009648954,-0.024765847,0.07553144,0.09852048,0.024822246,0.012125765,0.07951047,-0.06288479,0.04310094,0.03632242,-0.040533394,-0.044571098,0.0041661975,0.030954992,-0.035710033,0.0028968274,0.056185164,0.09408629,-0.002321156,-0.083690226,0.09237089,0.059286322,-0.006754358,-0.021566302,0.012784116,-0.021886576,-0.029847559,-0.102643564,0.07302648,0.033601873,-0.016687987,-0.028132912,-0.04454024,0.04066621,-0.08850353,0.024114158,-0.012382935,0.004158042,0.05715718,-0.0131471995,-0.016180575,-0.0035015028,-0.057769943,-0.030459281,0.1073883,0.03941663,0.07966273,0.083254084,-0.0736767,4.4670648e-33,0.01142182,0.009522317,0.0113437865,0.012869662,-0.01758516,-0.00044215145,-0.051318847,-0.015698235,0.13514087,0.06721666,-0.020167334,0.054788746,0.010257307,0.012717836,0.024878196,-0.009106877,-0.020596111,0.04864134,-0.036520965,-0.01101482,0.06606592,-0.039499782,0.039927248,-0.016351352,-0.013205038,0.08412074,-0.0024592057,0.011495909,0.04122564,0.0047446447,0.0101240445,0.036068093,-0.037283346,-0.0030145894,-0.009708174,-0.043364365,-0.0072776335,-0.0029381865,0.01050453,-0.025855867,-0.03819246,0.020758264,0.022727713,-0.03804309,0.026327897,0.042185485,0.13734233,-0.025039902,-0.043594163,-0.028008536,-0.09408445,0.0025060219,0.08714611,-0.05918883,-0.05062538,0.01904624,-0.005067936,-0.101641595,-0.02482899,0.04317437,-0.014545161,-0.028666645,-0.02905175,-0.010051033,-0.022941813,-0.03808104,-0.067944534,0.009003469,0.040446986,0.0027862412,0.019902287,-0.015980532,-0.1110199,-0.011172345,0.053015154,0.034556035,-0.001096991,0.007914984,-0.029815512,-0.101789415,0.047880072,-0.049124118,0.026870843,-0.031236412,-0.016486747,0.061070878,0.07962429,-0.034671616,-0.018587114,-0.009655562,-0.13792218,0.030929966,-0.06662102,0.02362449,0.018022677,-6.480187e-33,-0.046853736,0.055155538,-0.011375355,0.05888636,0.08736475,0.037670765,0.005224594,-0.053360514,0.052884612,-0.05145367,-0.04699172,-0.016109593,0.006669809,0.013114883,0.0069932784,0.04371825,-0.035666652,-0.13375075,-0.09949075,-0.06291154,-0.01114838,0.065908946,-0.09722397,-0.027709208,-0.06998294,0.12484831,-0.07045984,0.018643003,-0.06948974,-0.05629444,-0.048109848,-0.001028798,-0.0016976814,-0.00010815923,-0.029761432,0.010200613,0.01899125,-0.045649223,-0.100969225,0.09076965,0.024802463,0.07782804,-0.08584972,0.0023841818,0.028628899,-0.011485328,0.0068892743,0.024813967,0.062243324,0.02710239,0.0074424576,0.03309847,-0.0076375473,0.019871125,0.00577603,0.009248633,-0.0048390003,-0.059125427,-0.04638701,0.031309333,-0.03439684,-0.025860216,-0.07629249,0.0011204812,-0.016000826,-0.02633371,0.081041835,-0.0661123,-0.009661765,0.03225784,0.027061364,-0.054259714,-0.09580557,-0.13720892,0.05524416,0.036867477,-0.023909353,-0.06815127,-0.040140156,0.0120185865,0.023204723,-0.10198422,0.0620173,0.040233277,-0.095437534,0.050263762,0.06509664,-0.08884233,0.020465348,-0.061582632,-0.06377787,0.0028571496,-0.047563963,0.04521704,-0.019103581,-6.6778306e-08,0.014293941,0.026852794,0.019932253,0.009277831,0.050229553,-0.08992578,-0.089278474,0.15307763,0.020739907,0.069406785,0.023062544,-0.013925659,-0.047016095,-0.006153081,0.044884134,0.012448818,-0.008055004,0.06485056,-0.054661017,0.058262,-0.031909827,-0.04268796,-0.08575311,0.02270326,0.064183615,-0.013234452,0.07486512,0.059782732,0.060689654,0.024918908,-0.04694724,0.015572357,0.11556791,0.043987796,-0.047078945,0.0070068776,0.07452416,0.027972065,-0.06385186,-0.006762294,0.011144539,-0.048531685,-0.02329171,0.029984847,0.032445744,-0.001404283,-0.03881263,0.020737559,0.034775976,-0.018822165,-0.024796644,0.0061701303,0.018019106,0.093594775,0.065998286,-0.0072246203,-0.02012163,0.0019528975,0.008545042,0.01153286,0.07447768,0.0045351926,-0.06627614,-0.008988386,14,5.5531015,24.8378,6
397,"some of the points we covered in today's class were :
for heatmaps we studied that dark lines in heatmap signifies that the given submission has no resemblance with other submissions.

steps in ds are 
understanding the problem 
exploratory data analysis which includes sources of data and format of data such as text,files, database etc.
visualization that includes visual and mathematical visualizations.

six steps that we run cyclically for data analysis are business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation, deployment 
and when we should stop this repetitive cycle is the acceptance criteria of model

eda is an approach used in data science and statistics to analyse and investigate the data sets.
we study whether the data is continuous or discrete, dependant or independent, columns of data etc.

before data processing it is assumed that dataset would be cleaned and all the kinks have been removed.
if the data is skewed you need to apply transformations to make it normally distributed.

we studied a dataset of diabetes and pm10 also in which we studied about feature distribution, types of missing data, inter feature relation, multivariate approaches, situation of heteroskedasticity and homoskedasticity etc.",-0.018679818,0.043047015,0.0022956717,0.0055740057,0.00030849848,-0.07403602,-0.055830833,0.008047198,0.009223709,0.039451636,0.017780796,0.013493062,0.04726471,-0.024422469,0.017930409,-0.0691769,0.010115658,-0.024565186,-0.10248973,-0.039200205,0.020595405,0.035799664,-0.097801,-0.015558083,-0.025230344,0.060216784,0.09146284,-0.025872791,-0.06294588,-0.03242804,-0.041491844,0.017425157,0.0016951946,0.085334465,-0.020707395,-0.006101768,0.025910422,0.053203933,-0.06035108,0.029184388,-0.051638313,-0.0432233,0.014386133,-0.019970575,0.09582956,-0.07684065,-0.102547295,-0.07529446,-0.030222839,0.03004426,-0.08432232,-0.015990973,-0.009870399,0.058715407,0.022420924,-0.004060682,0.019289065,-0.10538226,-0.008575909,-0.064865634,-0.01744366,0.028625233,-0.08877987,0.042786706,0.056246098,-5.2290365e-05,0.03935793,0.010747413,0.07220495,0.0075589423,-0.057482895,0.040087573,-0.113700666,0.01904417,-0.031896457,0.019427387,-0.010412308,0.010212759,0.05156696,-0.12800333,0.06997091,0.07821409,0.034195065,0.06242011,-0.004597372,-0.024848042,0.00023876618,0.04870774,-0.013507471,0.0076598227,0.028754808,0.045436613,0.0042975955,-0.0018361385,0.04198629,0.038184933,0.010433466,-0.11627702,0.11368726,0.044114158,0.0035634723,0.012761654,0.020291064,-0.02188944,-0.058957957,-0.080857985,0.07999586,-0.054621123,-0.021679267,-0.0154252965,-0.06473241,-0.062327098,-0.07114458,-0.011574037,0.04433846,-0.1308459,-0.052670505,-0.02633739,-0.03162199,0.055871442,-0.039519448,0.042890366,0.099246435,0.024509212,0.05880283,-0.01953797,-0.036939632,3.9380317e-33,-0.0016525976,-0.036976118,-0.041393876,0.06735687,0.025452483,0.0051853196,-0.05614903,-0.046182565,0.028636724,0.0119444085,-0.009460388,0.1374636,-0.03634479,0.07434322,0.07707245,0.037932854,0.038617708,0.107066885,-0.04880201,0.04090321,-0.014024026,-0.07579048,0.09046542,-0.007735211,-0.0023074003,0.056082208,-0.032512885,0.042516463,-0.007800447,0.0075173965,0.015163009,-0.03524677,-0.030922845,-0.016866112,-0.0009211952,0.0013330957,0.054695558,-0.022186264,0.054111656,-0.009366933,-0.019412402,0.014146445,0.019042999,0.011408714,-0.0346825,0.11722497,0.03955169,-0.049342804,0.013706071,-0.0028668588,0.024356946,-0.031020671,0.032527193,-0.06900301,-0.055485614,0.07209387,-0.01061423,-0.12118904,0.028835623,0.044427034,-0.047479305,0.05132246,-0.017829996,-0.07056053,-0.050461095,0.0031517239,-0.087570496,-0.04594198,0.008588043,-0.059767686,-0.07632063,-0.059272837,-0.06179131,0.028327921,0.043560896,-0.046682555,-0.010911197,0.029069144,-0.006213627,0.062706694,-0.022110831,-0.07026106,-0.00084828795,-0.13221328,-0.010569978,-0.069101736,0.009433868,-0.0008302847,-0.03255804,-0.04135117,-0.0610066,0.08683833,-0.04167875,0.06414618,0.13692683,-7.061114e-33,-0.08206165,0.04821262,-0.007358521,0.107115135,0.07675381,0.029788608,-0.038116384,-0.03368359,0.12935965,-0.010241411,0.014026389,-0.06743467,0.011966159,-0.05859584,-0.020520816,-0.0021600309,-0.019299544,-0.05336186,-0.07110058,0.0077380645,-0.023384068,0.037693743,-0.09824663,-0.03683731,-0.0062445346,0.023976412,-0.078234345,-0.028124558,-0.036194414,-0.013141582,-0.015753768,-0.024647811,-0.034873072,-0.0062196106,-0.053957038,-0.02525899,0.051432323,-0.047911257,0.00885668,0.036309775,0.05291354,0.015208201,-0.01013178,0.027120102,0.008074883,0.014624899,-0.009415373,0.062040374,0.01714653,-0.0077403346,0.067533776,0.049345337,0.008651116,0.008022822,0.056860864,0.012037179,0.07816353,-0.048364412,-0.076609716,0.07015322,0.024022656,-0.02289364,0.02188548,0.016331896,-0.039584097,-0.034150455,0.05299468,-0.06000468,-0.06189902,0.022860363,0.05502,-0.039482974,-0.079152524,-0.046127122,0.08277299,-0.059003446,-0.03961355,-0.0105919335,-0.0056700236,0.024724869,-0.04374033,0.009752376,0.031530697,0.0867193,-0.03835104,0.0067363265,0.061735027,-0.09681767,-0.017153814,0.041043285,-0.06441239,-0.06892546,-0.09671181,0.15843974,0.02419378,-6.3707446e-08,-0.056215506,-0.069968596,0.075606644,-0.030307183,0.022722285,-0.07357101,0.0025542697,0.1049693,0.043500405,-0.05694748,0.10626128,0.026891239,-0.06822979,0.018818323,0.0592899,0.00948655,0.074490726,0.016507719,-0.051477417,0.015527003,0.06496912,-0.0079611875,-0.031893674,-0.03542116,0.083908215,0.011286269,0.0019023854,0.098674774,-0.022150965,-0.0035210622,-0.00680797,-0.015760586,0.025524827,-0.024398807,-0.018637992,-0.053992227,0.1374928,0.029841427,-0.050363068,0.00590984,-0.02871788,0.085537136,0.0014887673,0.015249555,0.010488533,0.03097949,-0.020696005,0.015026533,0.0064223898,-0.0121242525,-0.06146585,-0.025912262,-0.002487967,0.072890475,-0.009481796,0.017619507,0.010488749,0.013036114,0.016235543,0.00787359,0.03141912,-0.031231174,-0.08634267,-0.0022103267,4,2.202555,31.026493,6
412,"introduction to crisp-dm framework
the lecture provided a comprehensive guide to data analysis and problem-solving using the crisp-dm (cross-industry standard process for data mining) framework, which consists of six iterative steps: domain knowledge, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. it begins by emphasizing the importance of defining constraints, success criteria, and a project plan before diving into the data. the focus is on understanding the data, including identifying dependent variables (targets) and independent variables (features), and determining what problems can be solved with the available data.
classification of data problems
data problems are classified into two main categories: issues with dependent variables, such as missing labels (requiring clustering), incorrect or noisy labels (requiring noise removal), insufficient data (needing more data collection or synthetic data generation), or imbalanced data (requiring techniques like oversampling or undersampling); and issues with independent variables, such as within-column problems like missing values, outliers, incorrect representations, duplicates, uneven distributions, or too much data, and cross-column problems like insufficient features, too many features (requiring feature elimination using methods like p-values or heatmaps), or feature scaling issues.
exploratory data analysis (eda)
exploratory data analysis (eda) is a critical step, involving checking the distribution of variables, using box plots to understand variability, analyzing feature correlations with heatmaps, creating scatter plots and matrix plots to visualize relationships, identifying class imbalances and trends, and handling missing data by determining if itâ€™s mcar (missing completely at random), mar (missing at random), or mnar (missing not at random).
handling missing data
missing data can be addressed through methods like replacing with statistics (mean, median, etc.), using k-nearest neighbors or linear regression for imputation, or for time-series data, using interpolation or nearby values.
outlier detection and management
outlier detection involves techniques like sorting data and using the interquartile range (iqr) or standard deviation to identify outliers, applying dbscan clustering for multivariate outliers, or using t-sne to visualize high-dimensional data and spot anomalies. outliers can be true anomalies or errors, and true outliers may need to be processed separately. the lecture also highlighted the difference between univariate and multivariate analysis, where outliers may not be visible in one dimension but become apparent in multiple dimensions.
finally, it stresses the importance of iterative validation and thorough data preparation to ensure the data is clean and ready for modeling, leading to reliable and actionable insights.",0.05924107,-0.05171359,0.022331808,0.011184094,0.022582507,-0.0428979,0.030902231,-0.012145501,-0.17908055,0.027000368,0.012886571,0.0069346773,0.08134158,-0.018367382,-0.010392337,0.029692259,0.0053469604,0.0024508159,-0.04698557,-0.060880985,0.018470377,0.05320081,-0.036743607,0.06536895,-0.08325808,-0.018690506,0.061787385,0.010491613,-0.048151474,-0.010205008,-0.0038484915,0.07609232,0.015463301,-0.0024634239,-0.01003639,0.04719525,-0.036647074,-0.0021251042,-0.04445727,0.02080036,-0.01471897,-0.04618659,-0.01269059,0.0391213,0.06242653,0.00543196,-0.05846341,-0.0065452517,-0.0529738,-0.043904677,-0.07966275,-0.061722778,-0.025524197,0.028726814,0.021081772,-0.05670155,0.0049342043,-0.0028621072,0.004158973,0.005638142,0.021641599,-0.09425685,-0.02871262,-0.008546333,0.042112175,0.0052322415,0.026525434,0.015919095,0.014634659,0.0047096238,-0.024622556,0.042203844,-0.089849405,0.06586406,-0.033046562,0.022481816,0.04776044,0.008901622,0.09696778,-0.005187599,-0.010304815,0.031263612,-0.059671134,0.0054698302,0.1414805,-0.008782396,0.016881984,0.011469561,-0.03923333,0.0006910836,0.039863896,-0.025283962,0.01726452,0.02879558,-0.066029325,0.032164883,0.068671286,-0.039321344,-0.0066898544,0.06038217,-0.04388261,0.07125532,-0.019360267,-0.019316675,-0.02604553,-0.0063257935,0.0032957315,0.043484014,-0.045980915,-0.03995443,-0.015240803,-0.012445669,-0.033353414,-0.06063128,0.061267544,-0.062627606,0.040921368,-0.066250496,-0.050340865,0.05946908,-0.081300184,-0.048735872,0.055923183,-0.030963734,-0.0073502567,0.031961847,-0.1689165,7.7039615e-33,-0.036464904,-0.02313889,-0.0528349,0.023801623,0.007768505,-0.11325876,0.0018813602,0.0654047,0.012083773,0.06591435,0.029645333,0.0027175224,-0.0006295364,0.04420107,0.039248765,-0.08763483,0.0004430442,0.08457136,-0.057117876,0.001797256,-0.01748178,-0.07127293,0.056859236,-0.024888929,0.08198851,0.055737574,0.0015344378,-0.024136627,0.06678199,0.03237945,-0.011710459,0.005092246,0.05289623,0.042360276,-0.03694243,-0.017831257,-0.016029997,0.0044499966,-0.008519106,0.04697226,-0.09154591,-0.0013689515,0.02470287,0.0092655085,0.017994678,0.00911261,0.048784073,-0.04876547,0.04635134,0.068311736,-0.02233585,-0.07862312,0.041100025,-0.00860791,-0.100756094,0.09507881,0.017219868,-0.17754596,-0.020883968,0.008021173,-0.045243826,-0.005182074,-0.04495908,-0.015284279,0.046230618,-0.019587293,0.006450082,0.008005189,0.0441651,-0.04904347,0.0139425695,-0.01843079,-0.0112385675,-0.028177248,0.07877008,-0.024139216,0.049721245,0.06137474,-0.002534415,-0.058578882,0.042541943,0.040578995,-0.013308015,-0.093890086,-0.06777226,-0.016237473,0.012913149,0.010419815,-0.07400564,0.0071995263,-0.11236895,0.05664236,0.009624216,0.023711044,0.06424984,-6.69494e-33,-0.05617186,0.055704355,-0.029972037,0.083865836,0.03662795,0.023826564,0.003413887,0.0023572664,0.05651455,-0.09924804,-0.06294117,-0.054549847,-0.008420125,0.025989693,-0.07854265,0.032840583,-0.08164693,-0.0107491715,-0.013137204,0.08943399,-0.041313022,0.052332107,-0.09973547,-0.016341047,-0.06258187,0.06489125,-0.06768198,-0.021857873,0.07790399,0.0026480467,-0.004700885,-0.05533693,0.0010368059,-0.024186118,0.0040323585,-0.0053846156,0.03625359,-0.08656777,0.0207006,0.036063455,0.07216442,0.094520114,-0.08410886,0.0024867642,0.026042495,-0.06618794,-0.00023821444,0.048958115,0.04028246,0.04330756,0.00017825933,0.000423457,-0.022647858,0.03179019,-0.040151652,0.0461512,0.056608092,-0.0030815168,-0.04783889,0.089421555,-0.025565982,-5.3335032e-05,0.05832495,-0.006880003,0.031491883,-0.07594696,0.02204536,-0.003611535,-0.06298618,-0.001186377,-0.0814535,0.06643083,-0.014797443,-0.038004737,-0.011369679,-0.088402815,-0.075224645,-0.013335284,-0.036918994,0.06419311,0.08358437,-0.053098302,-0.0016339992,0.14023428,-0.0026552351,0.0969271,0.09960136,-0.015092787,0.030014092,-0.07102974,-0.06256335,0.03281263,-0.052701913,0.09834399,-0.014155173,-6.411256e-08,-0.0048403987,0.0046208613,-0.006549829,-0.016248139,0.06126667,-0.045265254,-0.03356307,0.09650661,0.01014956,0.0072362823,0.047262233,0.036700383,-0.15781537,0.04575208,0.051584978,-0.041766956,-0.002617251,0.09280338,-0.05779789,0.010025805,0.05593375,-0.017289385,0.006698281,-0.04885405,0.1393385,-0.111540355,0.033087306,0.102200784,0.027130563,-0.040807124,-0.061510228,-0.03568925,0.010152314,0.009365966,0.046353243,0.060701087,0.08524721,-0.022526892,-0.08361268,0.035575625,-0.03020682,0.07981297,0.019814864,0.049221,0.016495816,0.0069487123,-0.022851985,-0.020671193,0.060307868,-0.00920562,-0.022479435,0.07015393,-0.029138314,0.06181897,0.0013001625,0.0948722,0.019421376,0.012116013,0.01968636,-0.0022959178,0.060473766,-0.026837043,-0.08520041,0.057114184,4,3.8713996,28.568932,6
415,"sir discussed handling outliers and missing data, emphasizing their impact on analysis. he explained that outliers can be dropped, replaced using data sampling, or analyzed separately since the mean is influenced by them, but the median is not.
for missing values, filling methods depend on the column's distribution, and techniques like mnar, mar, mcar, regression, and interpolation help. sir also highlighted box plots, matrix plots, and dbscan for outlier detection.
he introduced crisp-dm, a cyclical six-step process for data mining: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation, and deployment. lastly, he stressed setting deadlines in ml work to avoid endless optimizations (he joked about ""asymptoting forever""). preprocessing is key before applying ml models!

424,"in todays class (14/2/25)
we started with the discussion about the evaluation of confusion matric via dataframe function and scikit function where we found they both are transpose of each other and while calculating the recall and precision values, we need to understand which function we are using to find accurate values for which we can analyse the number of classes we have and estimate which of the matrix results in perfect number.
next up we stated with exploratory data analysis which helps us to understand the nature of data. the brief steps in data science includes 
1. problem understanding
2. eds
3. visualization
the 2 and 3 helps us to visualize and understand mathematics behind the data.
next up we answered the question what to do when you get the data using the crisp-dm 6 membered cycle
1. business/ domain understanding [determine the objectives/ hypothesis/ constraints, etc]
2. data understanding [describe the data in format/ columns/ rows/ missing data, etc]
3. dara preparation [perform the required transformation to use the data]
4. modelling
5. evaluation [using the metrics]
6. deployment
the main 4 uses of eda involves
1. get insights
2. spot anomalies
3. test hypothesis
4. check assumptions
it completes the following task using 2 techniques: statistical graphics and data visualization
than we gradually understood the importance of eda 
after which we entered to learning about missing values where we found 3 types
1. mcar (missing completely at random)
2. mar (missing at random): there is some relation between value and other feature due to which we can neglect them
3. mnar (missing not at random): it includes data which is not relevant based on the domain for example the co sensor above 110 should give a null value, we have no use for it and thus the sensor is set in the particular way
what can we do? --> drop/ let it be/ give a good number like mean or median these are univariate solutions while knns(average o nearest neighbors) / mice (train a function and predict the value for it) are the multi-variate solutions. for time-series data we can use forward/ backward fill/ linear interpolation (calculating the value by line connecting the alternate avalaible points)/ simple moving averages
than we moved onto handling outliers which may arrive  due to data corruption/ faulty measurements or true outliers where median values can be used the best since they are not influenced by the outliers whereas means are so need to keep that in mind",-0.016158907,-0.024049334,-0.044296067,-0.03891679,-0.034754597,-0.07304135,-0.044742927,0.04626573,-0.052123368,0.033194155,-0.0050162296,0.021152077,-0.008605094,-0.064189665,-0.015167677,0.0035936916,-0.06582343,0.039086524,-0.08327241,-0.04498375,0.055456147,0.044158336,0.030886889,0.025155667,-0.039379213,0.015705757,0.076202065,0.013380894,-0.03350767,-0.048762314,0.02475336,0.10919793,-0.029269801,0.03572318,-0.046144567,0.055792388,0.026814532,0.05496719,0.04676682,0.049116913,-0.052748,0.002660421,0.028174898,0.030552043,0.053929087,-0.053501066,-0.091829225,-0.051865734,0.010856999,-0.006700286,-0.10770252,0.050118886,-0.04811016,-0.005970116,-0.0109756645,0.01662619,0.040775277,-0.025146589,-0.009347277,-0.0239445,-0.034236733,-0.0679831,-0.0010859721,-0.023225084,-0.010490962,-0.022926634,0.0042693675,-0.0076167006,0.02418023,0.005599322,-0.067100815,0.014007048,-0.0062841685,0.032576114,-0.06329603,0.04991625,0.017802263,0.026371688,0.05824573,-0.04226885,0.085422926,0.085704185,-0.04674847,0.016615173,0.047227632,-0.022314215,0.031087438,0.027559942,0.039158184,0.044349864,0.08174063,0.015560714,-0.013326034,-0.009727091,0.03293097,0.0888428,0.056485225,-0.057663623,0.06445972,0.06546222,0.016076244,0.054607585,-0.06751118,-0.09914185,-0.12151124,-0.053860184,0.053121906,0.050643146,0.02078415,-0.07913846,0.03819991,0.0032412172,-0.11144,0.036886465,0.039382245,-0.06852215,0.000651092,-0.04377003,0.03426139,0.021933913,-0.05779711,-0.0011218075,0.08952935,0.06676977,0.01242694,-0.02290525,-0.1078962,5.060686e-33,-0.03921946,0.012536493,-0.029822366,0.06948872,-0.021975204,-0.050031237,-0.064190656,-0.022030933,-0.028336385,0.07795561,0.0006539087,0.087218076,-0.0077995397,-0.0042920504,0.011511746,-0.037366305,-0.011380887,0.049669147,-0.08735826,-0.017673286,0.029037181,-0.007893548,0.07341409,-0.08593496,0.05390612,0.02260955,0.003913188,0.03042233,0.03320155,0.007917834,-0.074100986,-0.028191391,-0.002531917,0.03411239,0.012416665,-0.0041130944,0.06511451,-0.042412873,0.00995539,-0.025876168,-0.0076262555,0.03934897,0.0593596,-0.028949684,-0.043956045,0.0667341,0.07750195,0.029406128,0.07926785,0.053717423,-0.008707903,-0.08981839,0.005261282,-0.0055712834,-0.015354053,0.051889017,0.0047073807,-0.11863938,0.049084973,0.09010755,0.00022116292,0.028230285,-0.00045912655,-0.0215547,-0.08339209,0.013751758,-0.053230256,-0.0067055076,0.052340865,-0.03386388,-0.046971727,-0.021425249,-0.04489985,-0.0004220777,0.07768335,-0.029791048,0.01297945,0.038410705,-0.013253556,0.0039038104,0.11252652,0.010870327,-0.021036817,-0.06395815,-0.091119304,-0.021895612,0.04729083,0.016191212,-0.054582786,-0.014010092,-0.054001443,0.02010049,0.0064482153,0.03300498,0.02348018,-6.572513e-33,-0.045835614,0.08061091,-0.019821895,0.08605642,0.022053558,0.008781335,-0.012024867,-0.037000563,0.01734092,-0.07019917,0.010320026,-0.025868746,-0.03715566,0.008553653,-0.040515266,0.0070542493,-0.025438966,-0.066285774,-0.07494364,0.008108108,0.010504722,0.073514536,-0.08698643,-0.03481099,-0.04027731,0.09010904,-0.031708434,0.026402729,-0.0074079796,-0.028542383,-0.006016745,-0.098211035,0.0066906153,0.039434046,0.0035426882,-0.02546927,0.09776043,-0.12305323,-0.010456797,0.01841513,0.03180455,0.075555965,-0.12611423,0.01379519,-0.0064560925,0.00024972425,0.022474796,0.118995786,0.035332937,0.010904833,0.033312198,0.038400833,-0.037407532,-0.010930833,0.02760649,0.042984433,0.08203366,-0.0861924,-0.11388421,0.09105599,-0.041767064,0.033604432,-0.018826602,-0.0134716155,0.0040400214,-0.03828643,0.0060393787,-0.036285445,-0.06462903,0.04607058,-0.016781628,-0.003350512,-0.061652247,-0.119582124,0.052071076,-0.031434514,-0.03857202,-0.024891648,0.002388302,0.058586538,0.014748107,-0.016285237,0.04703708,0.13921122,-0.07488194,0.10187775,0.11106838,-0.04100992,-0.02204856,-0.0138008045,-0.071015246,-0.075265825,-0.016604204,0.061905254,-0.00625186,-6.752559e-08,-0.05052319,-0.029242385,0.027214473,-0.027814522,0.0037361456,-0.09388289,-0.06005889,0.09771364,-0.027390832,0.018729595,0.03739926,-0.031062579,-0.14086078,0.0067570675,0.036395274,0.04864555,0.07394719,0.1015069,-0.0502324,-0.009745904,0.085686274,-0.052314233,-0.0024222666,-0.0098803565,0.06715461,-0.024096409,-0.015165223,0.15286723,0.051647965,0.024626115,-0.05681926,-0.079011425,0.013853523,0.014908487,-0.011713495,-0.018382687,0.036861554,0.038263522,0.048310433,0.03470325,-0.07442489,0.023755042,-0.021203956,0.03211603,0.0034829683,0.021160258,-0.07281667,-0.030835738,2.5620271e-05,-0.019820744,-0.03643281,0.07584409,-0.06568579,0.10290043,0.0063461773,0.02262022,-0.06781081,-0.018647714,-0.055062477,0.020657606,0.0034886468,0.037144493,-0.13042025,0.009684577,4,2.439825,28.333492,6
426,"this lecture addresses practical data analysis challenges, particularly those encountered when applying a trained model to new data, and introduces the ""curse of dimensionality.""

data distribution mismatch: the lecture begins by discussing exam performance with new data.  the model, trained on original data, performs poorly on the new data.  kernel density estimation (kde) plots reveal that the feature distributions differ significantly between the original and new datasets. this indicates the data were sampled from different populations, explaining the model's poor performance.

exploratory data analysis (eda): the lecture then moves to a solution walkthrough, starting with eda.  this involves:

missing value handling: identifying and addressing missing values using techniques like imputation (mean, median, etc.) or more advanced algorithms.
descriptive statistics: calculating and analyzing descriptive statistics (min, max, mean, median, etc.) for each feature.
outlier detection: using box plots to check for outliers. in this case, no outliers were found.
imbalanced data: analyzing the ""ailment"" (target variable) and finding it heavily imbalanced, specifically with very low counts for heart disease. this imbalance makes accurate prediction for heart disease extremely difficult. techniques like oversampling and undersampling are mentioned, but obtaining more data is suggested as the most effective solution.
kde plots: generating kde plots for all features to visualize and compare their distributions.
curse of dimensionality: the lecture then introduces the ""curse of dimensionality,"" which arises when the number of features in a dataset increases significantly. this leads to several problems:

increased sparsity: data points become more spread out, making it harder to find meaningful patterns.
increased complexity: model complexity increases, leading to potential overfitting.
increased computational cost: training and processing become more resource-intensive.
distance distortion: distances between data points become less meaningful, as they tend to become more uniform.
consequences and solutions: the consequences of high dimensionality include overfitting, increased computational resources, and data sparsity.

solutions to the curse of dimensionality include:

dimensionality reduction: techniques like principal component analysis (pca) to reduce the number of features.
feature selection: selecting the most relevant features.
regularization: techniques that penalize model complexity.

434,"we learned about crisp-dm (cross industry standard process for data mining), a six-step, cyclical process. it starts with business understanding, where we define the problem and assess relevant statistics. then comes data understanding, where we collect and explore the dataset. the modeling phase involves building and evaluating different models, followed by evaluation, where we assess the results to ensure they align with business needs. finally, in the deployment stage, the model is finalized, and reports are generated. after that, we explored exploratory data analysis (eda), a crucial approach in statistics and data science for investigating datasets. we also looked at outliers and quartiles, understanding how boxplots help visualize variability and detect outliers. additionally, we studied inter-feature relationships using matrix plots to identify correlations between different features. we then learned about three types of missing data: missing completely at random (mcar), where the missing values have no pattern;

441,"exploratory data analysis (eda) is essential for understanding datasets, identifying patterns, and handling issues related to data quality. problems with the dependent variable (y) may include missing, incorrect, insufficient, or excessive data, while issues with independent variables (x) can arise within or across columns. outlier detection and management are crucial to maintaining data integrity, using statistical techniques and transformations where necessary. model evaluation often involves interpreting a confusion matrix, where tracking class distributions helps in understanding its structure. eda fits within the crisp-dm framework, a cyclic process encompassing business understanding, data exploration, preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. visualization techniques aid in summarizing key characteristics and trends, ensuring meaningful insights. additionally, concepts like heteroscedasticity, where variance changes across data ranges, must be considered to refine models and interpretations.

465,"the session started with an introduction to the confusion matrix, a tool used to assess classification models by a two-way representation of actual and predicted values. this was then followed by an overview of exploratory data analysis, organized into six steps: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. a ta illustrated a diabetes prediction model, utilizing different plots to examine data distributions. glucose and bmi were normally distributed, whereas insulin and pregnancies were exponentially distributed.
the session proceeded to touch on handling missing data, such as dropping values, imputation with the mean or median, regression, or estimation of values nearest to it ,this is referred to as multivariate data imputation.
a sample of nvidia stock price variations showed how drastic falls, while not being real outliers, at times may be falsely identified. t-sne plots were proposed for visualizing high-dimensional data in two dimensions and facilitating the observation of patterns and clusters that are otherwise not easy to discern.
the utility of employing the median over the mean in missing data imputation was emphasized, given that the median is less impacted by outliers",-0.019659093,0.017032912,-0.009415405,0.08756722,0.048983674,0.021850785,0.013857618,0.10281052,0.027800342,-0.0177759,-0.038221825,0.050584845,0.024765868,-0.05754503,-0.06438361,-0.08065924,0.0088010095,-0.06451758,-0.037689947,0.0008544988,0.03042375,0.033972252,-0.01695978,0.11492129,0.046223655,-0.030827094,0.004249722,0.019407755,-0.0670035,0.021700911,-0.060989488,0.050215553,0.04970771,0.047593884,-0.12538168,0.005239986,0.031784154,0.11605903,-0.011279393,0.01396263,-0.027929783,-0.06747355,-0.065409444,0.07010427,0.005418651,-0.04511845,-0.08280736,-0.025460491,-0.008946885,0.07028906,-0.15020455,-0.018371584,0.00026856645,0.02054893,-0.0029913061,-0.03363576,-0.13687101,-0.05878904,-0.0023053412,0.031457353,-0.024355026,-0.032746483,0.018070197,0.07259007,0.09310286,0.032817565,-0.0130476905,-0.0075552543,0.012212642,0.0035170473,0.012504797,-0.009092653,-0.08020442,0.034321565,-0.09675753,-0.001325475,0.07995055,0.063214324,-0.015030637,-0.0090482775,-0.0028547836,0.09043281,-0.015495347,0.042129446,0.042554807,-0.019247375,0.072906435,0.07020211,-0.046663273,-0.061681192,-0.02117146,0.023533052,-0.055437747,0.020234913,0.033581182,0.052764155,0.015283806,-0.09438521,0.061450925,0.045646057,0.03740333,0.03291053,0.028914338,0.017470283,-0.043498468,-0.10857628,0.032376323,-0.0008579955,0.042826038,-0.010237204,-0.045433044,0.070608616,-0.055045854,0.033490006,-0.04578429,0.016124962,-0.0017520313,-0.058145255,-0.028739687,0.062211905,-0.06467344,0.052767213,0.09089632,0.0051704315,0.04494388,0.065862335,-0.05412132,2.6542288e-33,0.0058015846,-0.044162963,0.024979023,0.046364076,0.009640387,0.027305892,-0.05818004,-0.006367872,0.09587488,0.099140435,-0.044083573,0.061735082,0.009577009,0.040431876,-0.03534837,0.03510151,0.034680817,0.013355784,0.00737041,0.029932259,-0.02247983,-0.02224556,0.023856914,-0.010913263,-0.032429278,0.1119615,-0.026322564,0.019326167,0.06526498,0.0075434716,-0.011678738,-0.009070275,0.08715146,-0.083261006,-0.011349142,-0.04882067,-0.0037714462,0.0029782953,0.06831234,0.03571331,-0.023874078,-0.010730137,-0.004407393,-0.052441508,-0.026668116,0.027324647,0.09645456,-0.067550264,-0.038644895,0.066211745,-0.09771321,-0.008417158,0.034836818,-0.014998796,-0.10615106,0.055196706,-0.0049934033,-0.13228215,-0.005874725,-0.022679757,-0.059408423,0.00080560497,-0.05866164,-0.048121423,-0.08376915,-0.022923358,-0.027360288,0.027308205,-0.01967977,0.020685088,0.0065693003,-0.015146092,-0.023133805,0.008063159,0.05141419,0.021488182,-0.047997657,0.0013608744,0.037852347,-0.045614854,0.07681407,-0.062650226,0.024123034,-0.03676016,-0.03903186,0.016456582,0.06588035,-0.05444154,-0.047224097,-0.08622439,-0.15646547,0.08426294,-0.05969184,-0.03454464,0.038339533,-4.8943933e-33,-0.07139046,0.042670075,-0.0022224747,0.053845473,0.007946042,0.014838554,0.018575879,-0.06911698,0.04343236,-0.035329662,0.009335113,0.0024166368,0.0025710026,0.0056976043,-0.013204176,0.08346943,-0.026476024,-0.083893135,-0.03777978,-0.09526467,-0.01576643,0.054235235,-0.05788511,-0.00021671373,-0.045884855,0.106666304,0.027155323,-0.008462758,-0.073173255,-0.08562008,0.0015557244,-0.054792993,0.018209396,0.03192005,-0.0077241836,0.017138846,0.0013218537,-0.051300906,-0.08691533,0.035526782,0.0637205,0.055800363,-0.10768982,0.00914997,0.011882573,-0.019645333,-0.011950703,-0.005670873,0.09500775,0.036454316,-0.029389944,0.024290735,-0.05377988,0.014823708,-0.021035625,-0.020214299,0.029281618,-0.01916306,-0.05079446,-0.00089862215,-0.0121820625,-0.009773397,-0.0038020632,-0.033130854,-0.027294533,-0.09425634,0.047610793,-0.010118773,0.058807865,0.011868025,-0.023059962,-0.05598426,-0.042146016,-0.12764156,0.0058593373,0.015242714,-0.04105806,-0.041160777,-0.055685103,0.003914794,0.037399817,-0.11003317,0.077558234,0.03381916,-0.051112376,0.06734642,0.034569718,-0.036182005,0.020845078,0.0054240753,-0.077507414,0.059800573,-0.06695071,0.0794066,-0.020313734,-5.2908558e-08,0.034782458,0.03855744,0.041371945,0.08462696,0.032890283,-0.06965789,-0.01754121,0.118440054,-0.0054639666,0.017445827,0.017061528,-0.03823705,-0.13267924,0.001316095,0.032250725,-0.027556544,0.038060155,0.08365926,9.1673035e-05,0.06970222,-0.052992452,-0.011531216,-0.052201323,-0.02188622,0.07796548,-0.058366798,0.0047299005,0.081870005,0.008225506,-0.020926096,-0.009811404,0.013813714,0.096519455,0.027628712,-0.040649828,0.0016995082,0.06816188,0.03757174,-0.0213064,-0.0032568336,-0.037461955,0.0013592513,0.015473825,0.027563415,0.022602975,0.038270004,-0.0016334172,-0.025067655,0.079015434,-0.04023218,-0.027553521,0.030229272,0.01960531,0.12772238,0.08641786,-0.01131987,-0.067627065,0.060697813,-0.018730482,-0.067214735,0.014789955,-0.038864773,-0.072530806,0.01422012,4,4.662632,25.44029,6
480,"in today's class, we discussed exploratory data analysis. crisp-dm is a widely used framework for data analysis. it has six steps that run cyclically: business understanding, which means knowing the domain, understanding the data, preparing data that is either transforming it, removing outliers, or adding missing data. then, we make the model using the data. then, we evaluate the model by applying it to the test data and checking its effectiveness. afterward, we think about what to do with the model and how to deploy it. eda uses statistical graphics and data visualization methods to represent the data. then we discussed doing the task during a particular duration is important, and having deadlines helps people to work accordingly. then we saw a mind map stating the methods when we know different situations about the dependent variable. then we applied eda to pima indians diabetes data, in which the outcome is either the person is diabetic(1) or not(0), we saw the histogram of each factor considered to get the outcome in which we see some were nearly normal, then we see the boxplot of these factors stating the variability in the data and outlier instances present in them, afterward we see their correlation coefficient with the outcome and we see a high correlation with glucose and age as more aged and people with more glucose level are prone to diabetes. we also see the scatter plots and matrix plots which shows more relation between the features, clusters are seen more visibly, but it can show the correlation between two factors only at a time. then we see the problem of class imbalance in which one class occurs more frequently than the other. we also see the india temperature data analysis, which majorly states that the temperatures are increasing as years pass for a particular time in a year, and also in a year, it first increases and then decreases. then we see about handling missing data values which are classified as: mcar- completely random data points missing, mar- some relationship between the missing data point and values in different columns, and mnar- the unobserved values themselves are responsible for the data being missed. we analyze the data and decide whether we need to add them or not, then we see that we have univariable data if we have just one column as independent variables and multivariable data if we have the combinations of such columns. then we handle the outliers by the median method and the standard deviation method, also we need to consider outliers sometimes as they have taken place and have an impact. among the quantile for outliers which are median and mean, the median is good as it is not influenced by outliers but the mean is impacted due to the outliers. at last, we saw that we just don't need to apply every technique to the data, we should get the domain knowledge, understand and analyze the data, and then perform the process of eda through the required and significant techniques.",0.03358219,0.023643516,-0.026925066,0.028714852,-0.0101304045,-0.050870698,-0.038568784,0.06960228,0.017707177,0.06094211,0.0047040367,0.092691354,-0.01632635,0.014420347,-0.005256678,-0.05481219,0.029706843,0.012757322,-0.09346966,-0.03378257,0.025129208,-0.010328225,-0.045521136,0.0028078367,-0.04500951,0.00017874694,0.042460654,-0.01030056,-0.021166038,-0.04695092,0.023321332,0.033557866,0.03397833,0.023276202,-0.07367979,0.09695059,0.049728572,0.086506024,-0.028792705,-0.03842614,-0.032999806,-0.0001742534,0.0060078297,0.0057946253,0.0683459,-0.10652751,-0.101096325,-0.07384977,-0.045295134,-0.0071611027,-0.10591335,-0.046265434,0.0091812955,-0.01645095,0.055817164,0.0074858693,0.020772852,-0.06305783,-0.038237978,-0.032626618,-0.04360186,-0.017766867,-0.04688835,0.035263374,0.069231965,-0.028271351,0.069709614,-0.019285664,0.046827063,0.0010768556,-0.034702327,0.002469114,-0.108505294,-0.012318846,0.012081986,-0.0003616403,-0.023087109,-0.013983865,0.06448871,-0.07706499,0.085965484,0.11275427,0.013215844,0.051540542,0.0055401567,0.007815911,0.023948494,0.015114797,0.0011197913,-0.013621166,0.049157172,0.031724647,-0.06411585,0.053998612,0.011727762,0.038367756,0.0052437796,-0.05667907,0.056376074,0.08851474,0.036628034,0.023620434,-0.0027005884,-0.07538307,-0.059918467,-0.11602794,0.048857145,0.0050900206,-0.048936095,0.018334663,-0.014660097,0.0022139878,-0.05817286,0.03767793,0.012206392,-0.07741122,-0.06534169,-0.0061913803,0.012395589,0.02676891,0.015754273,0.012443078,0.07599756,0.018330129,0.04909479,-0.0034521166,-0.0674356,1.5143056e-33,0.08036739,-0.03903177,-0.028788522,0.09508238,0.042688835,-0.05273354,-0.078140385,-0.033036716,0.023829881,0.06284208,-0.016669672,0.11118822,0.0017590345,0.08744989,0.016373688,0.0016413673,-0.04837072,0.08432601,-0.028768135,0.05607524,0.020979602,-0.09406559,0.03293588,-0.034866408,0.03878952,0.06702136,0.027477019,0.0565122,0.028178463,0.014867758,0.0004176543,0.004205909,-0.07284288,0.011198818,0.003285386,-0.029731685,0.03969863,-0.030625738,0.02360318,0.04459223,-0.002068825,-0.014913188,0.017531566,-0.016942268,-0.023287242,0.050090846,0.0645395,-0.02013111,-0.00050841353,0.02665814,0.012553353,-0.0055064633,0.06686502,-0.07445061,-0.07666415,0.067802474,-0.006460996,-0.14153466,0.01923991,0.03660982,-0.022940764,0.024505835,-0.02839623,-0.004838859,-0.040420085,-0.0037752662,-0.045017105,-0.026432024,0.017855778,-0.027824212,-0.06650071,0.00818794,-0.028976515,0.0056423275,0.047570173,-0.03733391,0.037829433,0.031436805,-0.022564657,-0.005210741,0.07706686,-0.060935702,-0.033909112,-0.08520604,-0.014248221,-0.0041693216,0.0011050737,0.015854437,-0.026590206,-0.020869745,-0.058991343,0.06316405,-0.020334026,0.019485736,0.055309314,-3.2282726e-33,-0.05503534,0.051293083,-0.02513079,0.07051928,0.11411537,-0.01251054,-0.03511866,-0.017934063,0.049314663,-0.046038613,-0.039448835,-0.06864258,0.05956713,0.043526582,-0.016637191,0.009105581,-0.017644376,-0.07954483,-0.11461974,-0.029063145,-0.029808322,0.0567254,-0.10498335,-0.07991234,-0.038072478,0.08277848,-0.09448092,0.017571056,-0.05864392,-0.04075765,0.0017542402,-0.06836286,-0.04770937,-0.04334473,-0.08025035,0.04793553,0.01926686,-0.11435742,-0.00452728,0.049374122,-0.0009014408,0.07336844,-0.04265824,-0.025436856,0.033333357,0.01658289,0.011602873,0.055488646,-0.0025749516,0.024465501,0.04276678,0.08701616,0.0071368585,-0.03638061,0.010826729,-0.061207745,0.07813784,-0.091877826,-0.070506215,0.088934615,-0.029557459,-0.062515296,0.0006179811,0.024121797,-0.05610965,-0.013108138,0.07635221,-0.09249978,-0.02868292,0.0031223684,0.031213598,-0.030182296,-0.088910826,-0.043645814,0.06573358,-0.0380223,-0.09889675,-0.0096416585,-0.019824503,0.014702214,-0.0015027764,-0.10793132,0.0696368,0.037719924,-0.044405077,0.046633888,0.028406091,-0.020638302,-0.0044318424,-0.0033672254,-0.094731435,-0.027502926,-0.108104154,0.14442953,0.022575062,-6.4005334e-08,0.018764826,0.019647663,0.049350496,-0.006823804,-0.004852121,-0.1186157,0.023726298,0.13914667,0.02957767,-0.0265725,0.09261004,0.010830651,-0.11692476,0.028310636,0.13861649,0.05442432,0.07562104,0.07846838,-0.052812576,0.030071866,0.06475483,-0.019804016,-0.0418129,-0.015048869,0.077465594,0.0008256955,0.01913569,0.12966105,-0.02684215,0.004584165,-0.028583242,0.02665953,0.006669012,0.034251887,-0.066796154,-0.05224866,0.10273932,0.0053063994,-4.2990665e-05,0.0362397,-0.0136064645,0.0337815,-0.026164941,0.06524875,0.020644592,-0.007945092,-0.030230569,-0.038530227,0.011993102,-0.011048598,-0.07489246,0.026197126,0.032881893,0.046594664,0.031228319,0.048921525,0.020081986,0.009441485,-0.05148533,0.055154156,0.007918995,0.014496567,-0.09399581,-0.03943188,4,2.7960846,30.690924,6
506,"multi-class confusion matrix-
we started off with investigating the confusion matrix in multi-class classification. it is an important measure to gauge the performance of models by marking the correct predictions as well as the misclassifications across multiple classes, thus helping us identify where the model can be improved.

data understanding and preparation challenges-
much of the session was devoted to the issues involved in comprehending and preparing data, with a close look at problems concerning both the target variable (y) and feature variables (x).

issues with y:
  data unavailability: in case of missing target data, unsupervised learning methods can be employed.
  incorrect data: incorrect values need to be checked manually or automatically.
  not enough data: this requires collecting more data or simulating/generating it.
  too much data: dealing with too much data can involve statistical sampling, big data 
   techniques, or binning techniques.

issues with x:
  within columns: problems like inconsistent formatting and missing values.
  across columns: inter-feature relationships can cause redundancy or bias, necessitating 
   proper correlation analysis and suitable adjustments.


crisp-dm methodology-
the crisp-dm methodology was presented as a guide for data science projects. its six stagesâ€”business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deploymentâ€”ensure that each step, from setting objectives to deploying the final model, is methodically tackled.

exploratory data analysis (eda)-
eda was emphasized as an important process for summarizing data attributes and discovering patterns or trends. it plays a critical role in:
- developing insights into data
- detecting anomalies
- hypothesis testing

practical eda presentation-
our ta shared real-life examples with multiple datasets. one interesting example was the ""aqi readings for maharashtra"" dataset, where missing values were handled. methods like imputation with mean, median, or mode, and even more sophisticated model-based methods were proposed to efficiently handle missing data.

handling outliers-
detection and treatment of outliers were also covered in the session:
detection methods: techniques such as box plots, standard deviation analysis, dbscan, and isolation forest were illustrated.
handling methods: techniques such as data trimming or capping by quartile ranges were explained, stating that although the median is resistant to outliers, the mean is greatly impacted.

533,"in today's class we first discussed how to know from the confusion matrix that whether the column or the row represents the actual or the predicted data? and for that we can calculate the sum of the actual number of total data sets from the confusion matrix and if it is equal to the total values of the data which is known as the support in the data analysis hence that value is the actual data set. then we learnt about crisp-dm which is crocus industry stranded process for data mining. this includes majorly 6 steps - business understanding, data understanding which means collecting describing and exploring data and then verifying the data quality. then comes data preparation which means selecting cleaning constructing and then integrating the data and also formatting the data after it comes modelling evaluation and deployment which we will learn later in this course. then we learnt about exploratory data analysis and its basic definition. can we learnt about heteroscedasticity - which is that when there is a large difference in the variance throughout the data set and we need to convert them into homoscedasticity. then the ta taught us about box plots like if the median lies roughly in the middle of the boxplot then the distribution is certainly normal distribution when we learn about different types of missing data like mcar , mar , mnar and some examples for each of their scenarios when we learnt about how to fill the missing data like when to use mean and when to use median. then we learnt about outliers which are the data sets that differ significantly from the rest of the data sets and how to detect them . they are of also two types univariate and multivariate . for multivariate we can use dbscan. we can just isolate outliers make two different buckets of data and treat them differently just so that they don't affect our original model significantly. means are influenced by outliers but median is not so median is a good method for calculating outliers and for median we need to first arrange our data in increasing

538,"today's lecture focused on the standard operational process for problem-solving, which consists of six cyclic steps: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment.

data understanding involves collecting initial data, describing it, exploring patterns, and verifying data quality. exploratory data analysis (eda) was discussed, emphasizing the identification of outliers using boxplots, studying feature distributions, correlations, and inter-feature relationships. recognizing trends in data is essential for understanding patterns and making informed decisions.

exploratory data analysis (eda) assists in revealing patterns, identifying anomalies, and visualizing distributionsâ€”such as glucose and bmi are reasonably normal, whereas insulin contains numerous outliers. missing values can be random or caused by certain problems, and methods such as knn can impute the missing values. class imbalance is also a problem, which needs to be handled carefully.",-0.030601887,-0.010228831,-0.01230528,0.005223768,0.0033464965,-0.06927871,0.019533727,0.024020595,-0.11199562,0.04744352,-0.015503668,0.049687497,0.0038172414,-0.034658033,-0.07212073,-0.017967694,-0.012121914,-0.027234863,-0.049285475,-0.070738405,0.034185454,0.08015625,-0.0073785274,0.054850735,-0.023248855,-0.0024597344,0.118242145,0.016004212,-0.04795764,-0.029346596,-0.0074492623,0.085998766,0.07368035,-0.032804094,-0.054843675,0.060368907,0.0013705185,0.026489036,-0.039705843,-0.019640984,0.052266322,-0.035065316,0.005646656,0.100104794,0.035254672,-0.012932151,-0.1532427,-0.013769379,-0.021201614,0.0027592212,-0.08277069,-0.08044721,-0.0013295197,0.038496815,0.086673036,-0.048195537,-0.06381262,-0.037167612,-0.052727442,-0.013271995,0.0007123613,-0.031918664,0.0056307246,0.029305855,0.09855922,-0.009430389,0.097210266,-0.0014980376,0.027895173,-0.025564816,0.000772574,0.037798073,-0.09488578,0.09617046,0.007682907,0.042981263,-0.0096631115,-0.04171787,0.070102245,0.02662057,-0.02021064,0.07406765,-0.011445477,0.04175077,0.10720775,-0.05307853,0.008018022,-0.03964179,-0.023060827,0.030242383,0.041579347,0.03516503,-0.032183647,-0.004555178,-0.056395452,0.04084654,0.03196669,-0.081633605,0.0040135602,0.0664242,-0.04554741,0.09687473,0.0021783542,0.013836338,-0.05155171,-0.073274285,0.06949796,0.04013081,0.0047325995,0.00057188346,0.016509825,0.001875164,0.0184437,0.04820274,0.037839673,-0.04519317,0.0436183,-0.06741694,-0.04737847,0.088692345,-0.091905296,-0.0060432153,0.06427205,0.01889938,-0.017703062,0.057463698,-0.10255696,3.167756e-33,0.009888973,-0.071433894,0.009830173,0.014733243,-0.009342079,-0.06672156,-0.060316484,0.033736277,0.0071991733,0.058636654,-0.031297732,0.06252348,0.021160504,0.085687146,-0.0062649557,-0.03468128,0.012533232,0.10044415,-0.021139065,0.035266872,-0.008875249,-0.06710889,0.059493408,-0.098352194,0.029386044,0.09037283,-0.016799202,0.05665369,0.12242026,0.012407911,0.0053062732,-0.031286374,0.026068168,-0.03506769,-0.05569941,-0.032108907,0.04166495,0.020608926,0.051250312,0.047706515,0.00498928,-0.010400655,0.024779202,-0.039582875,-0.020080121,0.09053715,0.07342566,-0.038808152,0.037757773,0.037465565,0.027801704,-0.07034866,0.027612772,-0.023362968,-0.08124593,0.061774798,0.0020636262,-0.100993335,0.021455089,0.009592571,-0.040016573,0.06923142,-0.05153657,0.009754484,-0.01081965,-0.061554413,-0.012921107,-0.058114633,-0.018794555,0.014013607,0.018953558,-0.063466616,-0.051713683,0.0042350185,0.009337454,-0.021717336,0.030196447,0.040359095,-0.02541826,-0.039848927,0.099252135,0.019284677,-0.03588649,-0.08393951,-0.07862486,-0.018157212,-0.011382094,-0.005402457,-0.04068801,-0.015652798,-0.12670156,0.03490894,-0.04687954,0.016916977,0.06895156,-3.9223738e-33,-0.073564775,0.063404076,-0.022584723,0.08133935,0.05316722,0.01253061,-0.019620268,-0.02067503,0.057976313,-0.0393306,0.050801277,-0.03478874,0.025114922,0.048848998,0.02172652,0.059099056,-0.07346992,-0.006500051,-0.04646982,0.00866597,0.0025443404,0.041729197,-0.08602937,-0.049481105,-0.026349574,0.08540513,-0.07727874,0.06423171,0.0061658886,-0.066214204,0.0021454026,-0.10763307,-0.012463764,-0.011733462,-0.039215904,0.0021683201,-0.0025381576,-0.071575135,-0.0073760655,0.045211922,0.06664655,0.078380905,-0.08838697,0.030514307,0.037287164,-0.072865985,0.036390048,0.027416237,0.08564954,0.0300349,0.010645114,0.04425148,-0.007998225,0.009836594,-0.004001984,0.021279132,0.06162189,-0.007173214,-0.07942864,0.07009489,-0.03922172,-0.054359496,0.011769207,-0.01337381,-0.0032778992,-0.03654275,0.08289723,-0.041621428,-0.045084383,0.007775196,0.04456213,0.070162654,-0.036336984,-0.032171976,0.017171737,-0.09266133,-0.06558743,0.024100894,-0.030138427,-0.02914701,0.026018951,-0.09314229,0.04761452,0.0524488,-0.03915996,0.0386182,0.08853487,-0.07938837,-0.020593155,0.008589248,-0.084867686,0.024918418,-0.07576812,0.062390123,-0.018642154,-5.016871e-08,0.05491113,-0.055009473,0.0069118626,0.04857665,0.0241358,-0.086839534,-0.04050282,0.096812986,0.036891326,-0.03724902,0.052438572,0.016191911,-0.13559091,-0.0064400686,0.10526248,-0.026861256,-0.025482018,0.095401056,-0.06452275,0.055239055,-0.004221038,-0.005943595,-0.05608371,-0.046083234,0.0853164,-0.059867367,0.023293186,0.08418243,0.026694639,-0.029817676,-0.03653916,-0.018670864,0.08297851,-0.011895653,-0.026255177,0.025829375,0.07593732,0.00051003014,-0.083399646,-0.034195624,-0.07795614,0.019713331,-0.025450632,0.007628538,-0.03254312,-0.0029581203,-0.01144067,-0.03271507,0.08692002,-0.003588113,-0.062496636,0.050679754,0.03805763,0.04364766,-0.024453742,0.084534414,-0.027533721,0.014378994,-0.014451768,-0.025200576,0.09534629,-0.061444193,-0.06645761,0.022768604,4,7.327924,26.69795,6
589,"data analysis begins with understanding the problem, which can be achieved through both visual and mathematical visualization. visual tools like scatter plots, histograms, and box plots help in identifying trends and patterns, while mathematical visualization through statistical summaries and correlation matrices provides deeper insights into data distributions. 
a structured approach to data mining follows the crisp-dm framework, which consists of six cyclical steps: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. during data exploration, heteroscedasticity (unequal variance of errors) and homoscedasticity (constant variance) must be examined, as heteroscedasticity can lead to unreliable models. another concern is multicollinearity, where highly correlated features can distort regression models. this can be addressed by removing variables, or using pca.

handling missing data is also crucial, using methods like mean/mode imputation or predictive modeling. similarly, outliers need proper treatment using techniques like transformation, or removal to ensure accurate and reliable data analysis.",0.06787666,-0.03430744,0.0007609549,0.032290757,-0.006192428,-0.02289231,-0.039969888,-0.05465333,-0.03272587,0.04655481,-0.0027300774,0.07855824,0.037520297,0.03413579,-0.04273773,0.0048208674,-0.01617937,0.011656818,-0.025650248,-0.10283969,0.0019604312,-0.034041494,-0.113990545,0.015370281,-0.02489532,0.009317458,0.05613015,0.016298428,-0.08675615,0.0058401073,0.026728874,0.025039064,0.022129813,0.0041642534,-0.04868358,0.017099304,0.027473846,0.05460443,0.02519478,0.045144405,-0.0368816,-0.03893899,0.02902384,0.060774375,0.03569911,-0.0498141,-0.085084975,-0.0966851,-0.03169282,-0.013231468,-0.12381981,-0.07634769,-0.015111242,0.019196643,0.031690113,0.011482779,-0.05514595,0.0010703561,0.06740157,-0.059051547,0.051271554,0.0031634353,0.041743208,0.016302742,0.09931636,0.025122877,0.033617888,0.055716727,0.0047991755,0.054418787,-0.010861693,0.028698174,-0.07705183,0.018258456,0.0034379093,0.05904781,-0.03330955,-0.04266594,0.10588891,-0.12011911,-0.0028729558,0.08428614,-0.08418127,0.05977037,0.077563114,0.04118802,-0.019075703,-0.05557053,0.009733514,-0.017945614,0.041165672,0.024929626,-0.011547654,-0.007561025,-0.06547832,0.043873418,0.05061356,-0.038909234,0.036379855,0.06536637,0.047135074,0.030264128,-0.015107798,-0.006311722,-0.061254784,-0.067801915,0.06643764,0.07572384,-0.04679384,0.0039340146,-0.035804827,0.025517354,-0.085346766,0.0139444005,0.034200087,-0.032925535,-0.004247394,-0.027922647,-0.0026318848,0.0800237,-0.023221103,-0.008680615,0.08650127,0.03263477,0.025561059,0.037701387,-0.11326037,7.08799e-33,-0.014289384,-0.025503742,0.024166234,0.058655158,-0.0058436478,-0.08519107,-0.036593705,-0.0340265,0.040401053,0.095790945,0.012839187,0.066722855,-0.020797934,0.062299807,0.02697333,-0.011755033,0.04400073,0.047923073,-0.07234612,-0.033429906,-0.03595939,-0.08249617,0.013578706,-0.0043247943,0.085374236,0.024998477,-0.004392688,0.026982157,0.0303027,0.044487517,0.0026017013,0.03691043,0.011853579,0.007954279,-0.05716498,-0.05437705,-0.027941903,-0.063081644,0.020089237,0.08757393,-0.08033601,-0.055986956,-0.010812816,-0.02586151,-0.0023410034,0.120063275,0.066367835,0.0060965675,-0.0068961536,0.013292795,-0.010441079,-0.03390365,0.018296698,0.025856726,-0.081213035,0.105887,0.012789058,-0.20501548,0.043259814,-0.034017973,-0.070915036,0.046409145,-0.019903716,-0.023627464,-0.034143228,-0.016990202,-0.001444658,0.03948134,0.02288259,0.02965728,-0.037526518,-0.017914828,-0.04145887,-0.012961079,0.054001506,-0.011956327,-0.0034587076,0.08461481,0.044647556,-0.031626858,0.09879936,-0.034411114,0.030423058,-0.08059566,-0.06327627,-0.01243097,0.056423314,-0.042414717,-0.028374879,0.008191025,-0.06533823,0.052926365,0.002018893,-0.030846812,0.028609892,-7.6411725e-33,-0.092089154,0.07941927,0.026495561,0.055418607,-0.0011404644,0.02907921,-0.04852401,-0.055357333,0.073625594,-0.11191656,0.009281265,-0.043273937,-0.06279773,0.04295572,-0.0034976276,0.040023167,-0.028984107,-0.024889113,-0.05963175,-0.0034432963,-0.012381751,-0.038044363,-0.08473202,-0.054338682,-0.039982777,0.071880855,-0.13311519,-0.008632947,-0.03448468,0.041277084,-0.01470052,-0.03565492,0.048484787,-0.044997405,0.008545037,0.022968994,0.0049835234,-0.07883872,0.038452476,0.0074078715,-0.008768237,0.035111655,-0.013174992,-0.013810553,0.019486038,0.027951358,0.03622353,0.073974125,0.054121707,0.041569266,0.005566888,0.066608556,-0.04761665,-0.031473987,-0.027034849,0.033490818,0.06510512,0.0026843625,-0.023234915,0.044992883,-0.057011392,-0.033176318,-0.018627381,0.0031839286,-0.038213108,-0.12184043,0.028318271,-0.08152972,-0.010772478,-0.06688774,-0.015257882,-0.029798305,-0.028560204,-0.056213852,-0.019336369,-0.08647042,-0.021981817,-0.0010460212,-0.033266235,0.08401146,0.105373435,-0.070605375,0.06358507,0.04840664,-0.014673305,0.07182626,0.031393304,-0.047251955,0.046030033,-0.07533702,-0.08088903,-0.013348956,-0.11248039,0.07842503,0.01080338,-6.1367174e-08,-0.037804388,-0.0070985793,0.038503964,-0.03857046,0.06482572,-0.059806354,0.019397283,0.12192898,0.043333106,-0.020026274,0.0557056,-0.06901612,-0.17638466,0.016806224,0.05305189,-0.00014565118,0.027659899,0.04762225,-0.046361465,0.03805343,0.019853152,-0.01176778,-0.009609552,-0.020804778,0.10332888,-0.048820984,0.007972249,0.13990803,-0.0016284722,0.027484788,0.005912388,-0.03054252,0.08847779,0.0060735913,0.012790649,0.07291435,0.050209183,0.051322635,-0.055128004,0.021644432,-0.053120036,0.10488276,-0.013779646,0.05956629,0.0058462876,0.014746528,0.009516346,-0.009558227,0.022234656,-0.022925897,-0.06299815,0.0117408,0.010424935,0.057417046,0.013932992,0.028043436,0.03091307,0.039111856,-0.021913713,0.0017974252,0.00039579967,-0.08546322,-0.061423603,-0.024586083,4,4.8325453,29.095358,6
599,"today, we went over crisp-dm, a six-step framework for solving data science problems, and the importance of exploratory data analysis (eda) with examples like pima india diabetes, ganga water quality (2012), and mumbai aqi. we explored box plots, matrix plots, and how class imbalance affects analysis.
the ta explained handling missing data (mcar, mar, mnar) using univariate methods (dropping or filling with mean/median/mode) and multivariate methods (knn, mice, regression models). we also covered outliers, their causes, and ways to handle them using iqr, isolation forests, and db scan. the median is more reliable than the mean when dealing with outliers.
lastly, we touched on the confusion matrix for multi-class classification, and sir mentioned that the midsem will focus on concepts, eda, and visualizationsâ€”no derivations.",-0.03882944,-0.046810377,0.036624517,-0.012479283,0.029253837,-0.061208423,-0.016108584,0.04900448,-0.060431316,0.05340319,-0.05016077,0.0093464255,0.014914479,-0.018291717,-0.0628068,-0.021822799,-0.052008603,-0.010431407,-0.05544315,-0.04334316,-0.0133329965,0.07463532,-0.005462977,0.042088445,-0.044671003,-0.004473326,0.04550198,-0.040530186,-0.09708149,-0.040847357,-0.00945089,0.10500542,0.010999599,0.00053634826,-0.132004,0.03691619,0.04481546,0.08821735,-0.0075775473,0.0020454915,0.005378359,-0.0043278537,0.026521314,0.04707813,0.025690531,-0.024831997,-0.13815014,-0.10310498,0.023186501,-0.033120964,-0.09795082,-0.023973068,-0.04156738,0.039107855,0.016474886,-0.09650438,-0.026621284,-0.044651326,-0.033396628,0.0071085407,-0.01802474,-0.019347677,0.010752451,0.0119267125,0.09035272,-0.03161331,0.03580785,0.077890635,0.015148612,0.040229745,-0.0045560515,0.017487818,-0.09419525,0.04149038,-0.0085249,0.027822053,0.014340383,0.02648603,0.016688565,0.05711913,-0.01005984,0.08510202,0.010407876,0.04474624,0.07922677,-0.027115755,0.004511802,0.016382134,-0.038348753,0.0010150259,0.022169389,0.030533962,-0.005152979,-0.0128763355,0.0113198375,0.05865306,0.013886789,-0.082396425,0.03592857,0.063058786,-0.013162074,0.030107714,-0.02617652,-0.04971053,-0.006250317,-0.11104556,0.10349219,0.007499472,0.08145332,-0.054227713,-0.051322732,0.008572049,-0.06585818,0.0017369854,-0.017641693,-0.044138152,0.10237588,-0.031324483,-0.008938313,0.0011898831,-0.090676814,0.0081438,0.06546475,0.039315354,0.10025826,0.08437459,-0.13312618,1.633235e-33,-0.0063446956,-0.043460507,-0.007398954,0.041853316,0.051397234,-0.07582542,-0.06558978,-0.030832747,0.03747646,0.07904758,0.020593038,0.061436057,-0.023360014,0.030919028,0.047555294,-0.007952126,-0.023589553,-0.007844229,-0.049078297,-0.031128358,0.00015830332,-0.046125893,0.05592386,-0.05016594,-0.0063830167,0.091893844,0.04192396,0.0010092634,0.07837915,0.0035187923,0.025476202,-0.006451815,-0.004756631,-0.0039107925,-0.021226361,-0.051527455,-0.006814548,-0.008259018,0.047533613,0.033190425,-0.051879026,-0.019662825,-0.0031055862,-0.05690138,0.037244953,0.06639899,0.07215194,-0.020190155,0.033592768,0.035734575,-0.05348431,-0.037603166,0.042684402,0.017141253,-0.048603512,0.05445202,-0.010075813,-0.073495306,-0.0035807053,0.009700167,-0.045587923,0.0073447092,-0.015000737,-0.030550867,-0.028626509,-0.025041616,-0.02897765,0.0066418634,0.025145283,0.032821838,-0.0027241316,-0.025290312,-0.081201844,0.030036202,-0.0113168815,0.020335484,0.035589155,0.018980186,-0.011631786,-0.017476201,0.09620407,0.012887728,0.021946957,-0.054147016,-0.07536454,-0.0059698606,0.08740508,-0.045377128,-0.0033277695,0.02506114,-0.085255526,0.05655493,-0.02272878,-0.03293419,-0.004958796,-3.135564e-33,-0.07493129,0.06361804,-0.06785767,0.0510584,0.052044123,0.01171431,0.01775495,0.0042115534,0.08342673,-0.036836777,-0.03075659,0.01495437,0.032293312,0.019928342,0.03690339,0.03890966,-0.034072343,-0.022801757,-0.09186825,-0.026160143,0.020352444,0.0696265,-0.033190485,-0.024956807,-0.11213111,0.076080166,-0.08714005,0.040574104,-0.105839185,-0.08849599,-0.033628676,-0.055151403,0.023854876,-0.045187257,-0.0580474,-0.008776276,0.017719403,-0.07020031,-0.050640725,0.09718412,0.015310416,0.056494683,-0.078203134,-0.023410901,-0.017247824,-0.0025780043,0.013368819,0.0655461,0.002726955,0.049122952,0.012969448,0.017846076,-0.01356907,0.0031792745,0.0585535,-0.04301054,0.106826216,-0.03572439,-0.09086116,0.11677386,-0.036597,-0.0047635855,-0.0124380635,-0.025520004,-0.04983711,-0.090047814,0.10344667,-0.010975204,-0.037945773,-0.012064012,0.019779544,-0.0124301845,-0.053072,-0.088209786,0.042867552,-0.001975179,-0.10984509,0.0163948,-0.020172117,-0.008661263,0.070476204,-0.06941673,0.054685477,0.07468063,0.0007881661,0.067438446,0.096666284,-0.084981106,0.04254164,-0.051930994,-0.063840136,0.02318825,-0.045801792,0.058927126,-0.009123182,-5.040661e-08,0.02508885,-0.00080054026,0.0014990406,0.010710471,0.015031859,-0.08141206,-0.07182142,0.20091256,-0.007583896,0.084864065,0.069598325,-0.032177795,-0.10263615,0.008697313,0.103195496,-0.027840776,0.031388495,0.1079061,-0.058786847,0.051432192,-0.0111050485,-0.01797807,0.02675339,-0.0041997447,0.08589572,-0.049328048,0.01545888,0.06708077,0.043987863,0.045086555,-0.04256111,0.011161084,0.051039577,0.018464886,-0.018553808,0.06274807,0.07833792,0.02271781,-0.080498755,0.052074585,-0.06694384,-0.011575295,-0.030468794,0.017641332,-0.003641476,0.038482662,-0.053838607,0.0056369742,0.084606595,-0.042061783,-0.044218116,0.030105112,0.058607113,0.08580635,0.042411253,-0.005032623,-0.035171807,0.0023362986,-0.010020872,-0.006027181,0.10598558,0.02859014,-0.082981154,0.01882027,4,5.873982,26.527626,6
607,"in the previous lecture, we discussed how to use a confusion matrix to evaluate the quality of results. itâ€™s important to verify whether the rows in the matrix represent actual or predicted values, as they can differ.

exploratory data analysis (eda) and crisp-dm
the crisp-dm (cross-industry standard process for data mining) methodology is broken down into six steps:

business understanding: define the objective, set goals, and plan.
data understanding: collect, describe, explore, and verify data quality.
data preparation: select, clean, construct, integrate, and format data.
modeling: choose techniques, design tests, build, and assess models.
evaluation: review results, evaluate the process, and plan next steps.
deployment: plan deployment, monitoring, maintenance, and report creation.
challenges in data
dependent variable (y): common problems include incorrect data (manual or automated checks), insufficient data (addressed by collecting more, simulating, or using undersampling/oversampling), and too much data (handled through sampling).
independent variable (x): issues include incorrect representation (solved by encoding), heteroskedasticity, insufficient features (resolved by feature engineering), too many features (dimensionality reduction), feature scaling problems (normalized via standardization), and collinearity (addressed through correlation analysis).
eda on pima indians diabetes dataset
box plots: help identify feature variability and outliers.
feature correlation: shows strong relationships between features.
matrix plots: highlight deeper relationships between features.
clusters and trends: identifying trends or clusters within data can show seasonality or recurring patterns.
handling missing data
types of missing data:

mcar: missing completely at random.
mar: missing at random (data missing due to external factors, e.g., sensor failure).
mnar: missing not at random (e.g., missing data because it exceeds a threshold).
methods to handle missing data:

delete instances: remove rows with missing data.
impute values: replace missing values with mean, median, etc.
multivariate imputation: use algorithms like k-nn or mice (multivariate imputation by chained equations) to predict missing values based on other data.
for time series data, missing values can be filled in with close temporal values, assuming small variations.

handling outliers
univariate outliers: identify outliers using the interquartile range (iqr), defined as q3 - q1. outliers fall outside the range of [q1 - 1.5iqr, q3 + 1.5iqr].

normal distribution method: points outside the normal distribution range can be considered outliers.

multivariate outliers: use density-based clustering methods (e.g., dbscan), where points with few nearby neighbors are treated as outliers.

handling outliers:

drop outliers: simply remove them from the dataset.
capping: apply limits to outlier values.

true outliers: some extreme values may not be erroneous and provide valuable insights and should be handled based on domain knowledge. such outliers should be treated independently and cautiously based on their impact on the model and their relationship with the data.",0.0077792816,-0.0052179685,-0.03211839,0.0026058482,-0.015311666,-0.1122656,-0.020798307,-0.00023128992,-0.10663988,0.037290685,0.013964309,0.012147603,0.07868245,-0.032173596,-0.03170334,0.049077556,0.0366847,-0.024700409,-0.042318113,-0.060727622,0.07245409,0.03273483,0.005124782,0.030338138,-0.07112554,0.010062368,0.055668853,0.07005952,-0.06250618,-0.061127108,-0.011263256,0.10040538,0.004879665,-0.02689488,-0.019303156,0.0443094,-0.009944768,-0.015108936,0.0385841,0.049236488,-0.020022463,-0.037122473,0.009554445,0.050846625,0.05912961,-0.027724506,-0.08129855,-0.03688226,-0.057948567,0.05195527,-0.094327256,-0.04248925,0.031709254,-0.06692906,-0.00510474,-0.040601086,-0.061323386,-0.012323222,-0.04440445,-0.039979253,0.011848412,-0.070206635,-0.02207413,-0.0031152403,0.04461673,-0.019187268,-0.06661192,-0.008569084,-0.020263232,-0.026882106,-0.032081474,0.008065407,-0.06558114,0.021470303,-0.14129473,0.0741497,0.049628112,0.025687728,0.053452376,-0.034643356,-0.020602377,0.082908966,-0.10580566,0.042319737,0.07618206,-0.033734538,0.075870536,0.02672768,-0.010181645,0.03316468,0.11516285,0.014156254,0.007739224,-0.009451823,0.0061524645,0.080431156,0.03616802,-0.07224245,0.030510532,0.067626014,0.00898931,0.11145556,-0.020831134,-0.079881884,-0.09198385,-0.016133284,0.0147187505,0.0940094,-0.010382967,-0.024852393,-0.03811591,-0.007352282,-0.064796604,-0.02773135,0.05764058,0.0149878,-0.012110545,-0.007286832,-0.0071805376,0.099939376,-0.02559951,-0.0113259675,0.07061718,0.026679939,-0.0159094,-0.005299748,-0.07045823,5.4950743e-33,-0.055714007,-0.015911648,0.006676305,0.095476426,0.026638202,-0.032110196,-0.028751597,0.002267527,0.012550749,0.025048142,-0.0057224883,0.06734471,-0.0280232,0.041568182,0.012242374,-0.0077344943,-0.018429933,0.056860503,-0.06693624,-0.012077752,0.073086284,-0.11605617,0.036475275,-0.041529756,0.07593188,0.026974697,0.042386558,0.03819965,0.011671183,0.012180747,-0.00068568735,-0.045806147,0.07759697,0.055919163,-0.04243304,0.02155366,-0.06257869,-0.016427916,0.009270755,0.03417825,-0.010766137,-0.008908181,0.02807336,0.019264195,-0.014976094,0.058587227,0.019169815,-0.046993516,0.057698693,0.049886603,0.034565188,-0.053975344,0.028475536,0.008689129,-0.06750169,0.061609663,0.042385854,-0.15279013,0.027033703,0.021878075,-0.0632149,-0.0022330633,-0.095848195,-0.013402499,-0.020623207,0.010909157,0.01759922,0.014939241,0.036380656,-0.041732166,-0.021624297,-0.049144447,0.008992583,-0.036244135,0.01434909,-0.0699188,0.0014054623,0.07573496,0.024427952,-0.03657902,0.099341854,0.09331901,-0.017325155,-0.05876934,-0.06393917,-0.029491268,0.017050745,0.0082912585,-0.054555815,0.060305584,-0.08822712,0.10327958,0.0073378617,0.00679222,0.06340507,-6.3840665e-33,-0.06592455,0.06381929,0.046641927,0.071239695,-0.01394591,-0.03076946,-0.007901677,-0.02459233,0.09171008,-0.06818887,-0.049475268,-0.04432956,-0.05561563,0.0041815345,-0.021403281,0.04611336,-0.0026712667,-0.056365255,-0.017269088,0.009801437,-0.005948771,0.079332955,-0.09594045,-0.015682064,-0.064237036,0.09245298,-0.023706462,-0.011905122,0.06827937,-0.012762607,-0.0073029357,-0.05759532,-0.0017742417,0.0672154,0.018680109,-0.022721259,0.04894928,-0.062789895,0.043296885,0.044726904,-0.0017902324,0.088953495,-0.07564909,0.014219706,-0.012709762,-0.05582866,0.03287971,0.017991936,-0.01493484,-0.04620105,-0.0097682085,0.024307951,-0.07427878,0.039995942,0.008499572,0.039951295,0.04841974,-0.037403546,-0.093674056,0.09628824,-0.0022518658,0.014916744,0.02888549,-0.03281064,-0.010656387,-0.05646987,0.041214995,-0.0042155967,-0.035052765,0.027789848,-0.055544253,0.0014263489,-0.04641887,-0.09419723,0.037733983,-0.110499665,-0.04753253,-0.023855586,-0.052989103,0.08113231,0.02894239,0.0065335673,4.1411582e-05,0.09928311,-0.03657552,0.07249973,0.07083871,0.0053143916,-0.012243369,-0.0075349784,-0.066924475,-0.038481526,-0.052521825,0.0749795,-0.021140784,-6.911514e-08,-0.06862875,-0.0047048773,0.052171048,0.012442781,0.033621654,-0.11343976,-0.024591094,0.08556004,0.04269272,-0.033126626,0.041114807,-0.027223269,-0.17218067,0.014444518,0.06157319,-0.03270492,-0.005787554,0.118941076,-0.036268335,-0.0112684015,0.026485566,0.010634927,-0.028898891,-0.04153186,0.11106117,-0.07782494,-0.017368104,0.11259609,0.00473164,-0.005311232,-0.00032385558,-0.057449676,0.084998794,-0.002910208,-0.03291552,0.012917666,0.106804624,0.008837323,0.030031301,0.023335328,-0.059541374,0.11314178,-0.007831976,0.045906518,-0.030206958,-0.0010929238,-0.061485637,-0.06591703,-0.035281233,-0.08902391,0.024927553,0.028632592,-0.013280019,0.07497106,0.05911383,0.04400545,-0.020242898,-0.003532867,0.0019354403,0.00033716834,0.0664307,-0.05197615,-0.06663712,0.05621954,4,3.202145,28.766409,6
613,"we started with eda(exploratory data analysis). i learnt that any data related job involves 6 cyclic steps/phases.
1. business understanding/ domain knowledge
2. data understanding
3. data preparation
4. building a model
5. model evaluation
6. deployment of the final model
then one of the ta presented about eda on the following topics
a) data visulaization
b) handling missing fields in the data: one can ignore those data points, replace with mean or median or mode based on the distribution of the missing field, cluster data and take mean. in case of missing values in time series, one can use linear interpolation, spline interpolation
c) handling outliers: using box plots really helps. i learnt an interesting idea: median is not influenced by outliers but mean is.",-0.058522604,0.018233275,0.07473335,0.021917477,-0.041583095,-0.07220451,-0.08196033,0.015643166,-0.026713125,-0.003461511,-0.009695869,0.036720127,0.023249647,-0.017343203,-0.010240837,-0.04294505,0.0061202864,-0.032455284,-0.048571166,-0.09501567,-0.070109256,0.008613278,-0.08430894,0.013951977,0.0071046306,0.032328043,0.06801599,-0.0059359637,-0.042004373,-0.057770234,-0.033267025,0.032241102,-0.0011546828,0.006148316,-0.03503204,0.030221963,0.10694842,0.08279688,0.0056009744,-0.025510194,-0.034578346,-0.005959402,0.03227235,-0.021301877,0.047908936,-0.13988739,-0.023102192,-0.10951348,-0.008720184,-0.016487408,-0.053169362,-0.030242676,0.03471037,0.09062401,-0.01478763,0.013298569,-0.015596108,-0.06479579,0.022869576,-0.04896474,-0.0053624786,0.009481619,-0.004391403,0.023453377,0.03603742,-0.009980381,0.061501164,0.05436439,0.025636079,0.030181587,-0.009084178,-0.0043432834,-0.101020984,0.028407183,0.031137433,-0.0060653626,0.0042944252,-0.04461554,0.033748444,-0.05506561,0.028877368,0.0714677,-0.04714118,0.067951486,-0.033051576,-0.016414963,-0.020505993,0.02205319,0.025062032,-0.010428105,0.05335527,0.050748453,0.012871687,-0.018198838,0.09030755,0.06826527,0.012398682,-0.05628412,0.06932863,0.032624885,0.039777126,0.012563198,-0.033919368,-0.0372131,-0.048142307,-0.029465886,0.062351726,0.02835815,-0.044678636,0.022193898,-0.05206669,-0.021184472,-0.034722436,-0.005636572,0.052203976,-0.06332447,0.04849654,-0.03159009,-0.04350519,0.0033962668,-0.027159661,-0.007944001,0.04307314,0.07117327,0.089504786,0.044420466,-0.05943463,5.8170987e-33,0.02747046,0.017115409,-0.025559386,0.02106234,0.055174842,-0.0059111277,-0.061271183,-0.013523012,0.06855369,0.054904323,-0.027820984,0.102198124,-0.015766118,-0.012145103,0.04913024,-0.066153705,0.041204,0.060321722,0.009738673,0.059407033,-0.009166714,-0.11631939,0.009412895,0.0007655495,0.03520647,0.09508853,0.10506425,0.009634089,0.057843026,0.0016345964,0.036627192,-0.01985061,-0.0387342,0.0326693,-0.00041117653,0.005114113,0.0076875696,-0.029487463,0.05768996,0.03982186,-0.02000492,0.016418977,0.018625159,-0.057777345,0.0026449321,0.07446937,0.067182794,-0.040268283,0.037228692,-0.026820874,0.0223781,-0.044540435,0.04049279,-0.040447008,-0.059336048,0.046960104,-0.014702212,-0.1392055,0.02283358,-0.0028819388,0.011657337,0.01840547,-0.028268002,-0.04274164,-0.038861986,-0.029984334,-0.056906026,-0.0026554163,-0.021184552,-0.018752573,-0.020347632,0.001236628,-0.0877049,0.045901675,0.055541735,0.0034883046,-0.026067404,0.04162024,0.016041907,0.003677647,-0.0004889514,-0.048478544,0.07009647,-0.09630721,0.046870254,-0.038300175,0.063265935,0.009448404,-0.026166895,-0.058290314,-0.04555882,0.03367506,-0.05319957,0.08402933,0.030363234,-5.738119e-33,-0.028720494,0.07414051,0.031381022,0.03759654,0.078896716,0.04053816,-0.0337013,0.005450208,0.17372268,-0.062189266,-0.08678231,-0.048378915,0.013453718,-0.0061006346,0.000104298415,-0.026855974,0.0366276,-0.14111839,-0.03419134,-0.002955025,0.0030349032,-0.0531982,-0.12377988,-0.0064349812,-0.040317234,0.033189684,-0.116874725,-0.004635474,-0.10843928,-0.021250205,-0.01446465,-0.035457604,0.048603356,-0.05447974,-0.10254959,0.057352968,0.01943332,-0.06086378,-0.042574603,0.0012494985,0.03908119,0.026857177,-0.0239189,-0.0009278066,-0.010218827,0.02705227,-0.029436039,0.12229642,-0.060436215,0.062911466,-0.0023473576,0.058205996,-0.013757094,-0.009463463,-0.01560149,0.013341312,0.13443314,-0.041722156,-0.080535725,0.05867296,-0.019402139,-0.01843424,0.022120003,0.002025665,-0.054295167,-0.018353809,0.062206037,-0.06783742,-0.08250955,-0.02878455,0.07570312,0.018837035,-0.069304295,-0.055737972,0.039671224,-0.022254575,-0.05276477,-0.05169545,0.007030329,0.02251455,-0.0354573,-0.053702738,0.02750949,0.07725078,-0.035269063,0.13787563,0.035758123,-0.09364685,-0.009115817,-0.033320244,-0.07413479,-0.049782246,-0.047609176,0.095296815,0.029533451,-5.1023825e-08,-0.06652795,0.006213998,0.028095271,-0.022352386,0.00722311,-0.11913065,0.0043177023,0.13448095,0.05249607,-0.06270752,0.008016469,-0.09905068,-0.117589936,0.044667307,0.12910175,0.06343211,0.09305482,0.09376472,-0.060639188,0.011148785,0.101299115,0.01653913,0.010928767,0.013539253,0.07981905,-0.0017313767,0.028421821,0.06461819,0.029117532,0.014521907,-0.040931497,-0.0071821767,0.029868474,0.0028744948,-0.005773078,0.020333365,0.09500467,0.0012192717,-0.09380769,0.029285463,0.00047406394,0.06284064,-0.019757435,-0.034471374,0.03692953,-0.0071503343,-0.045507323,0.02314524,0.036292203,-0.036439624,-0.01006058,-0.024089964,0.033253398,0.042607408,0.051449165,0.0016183807,0.056078672,0.0077927066,0.019864218,0.018489202,0.027040493,-0.041127156,-0.10696063,0.02283082,4,7.115279,30.440296,6
624,"we were taught about crisp-dm (cross industry standard process for data mining), a cyclical six-step process. we begin with business understanding, defining the problem and examining pertinent statistics. next is data understanding, gathering and understanding the dataset. the modeling stage entails constructing and testing various models, followed by evaluation, where we test the outcomes to make sure they meet business requirements. last but not least, in the deployment phase, the model is completed, and reports are produced.then, we learned about exploratory data analysis (eda), an important statistic and data science method for examining datasets. we also considered outliers and quartiles and recognized how boxplots can display variability and identify outliers. we also learned about inter-feature relationships with matrix plots to look for correlations among various features. we then discovered three categories of missing data: missing completely at random (mcar), in which the missing values are not patterned; missing at random (mar), in which missing data is a function of some observed variables; and missing not at random (mnar), in which the missing values are a function of unobserved variables. finally, we talked about true outliers, which are outliers in a dataset that are not errors but real observations.",0.017736755,-0.02351853,0.006294426,0.05299406,0.018642634,-0.030558763,-0.07511568,-0.03151272,-0.012572578,0.0048489794,-0.026178407,0.07425994,0.022547226,-0.021510035,-0.044279367,-0.04041806,-0.0001757318,-0.022218091,-0.07066082,-0.07937457,-0.070532806,0.048285753,-0.029364282,0.010799965,0.00012681585,-0.024962619,0.041579183,0.026118044,-0.06455229,-0.019920925,0.020867152,0.08488215,0.012312391,-0.012140574,0.016406843,0.043470487,0.073624864,0.07067138,0.018694226,-0.0007347135,-0.023192456,-0.032829992,0.007502577,0.048330504,0.068282865,-0.037954837,-0.06282503,-0.1023707,-0.036670987,-0.015609306,-0.087543815,-0.025396464,-0.00046999546,0.062011894,0.0023715948,-0.05058696,-0.02691728,-0.02926194,0.038477905,0.007639186,0.026301095,-0.061216015,-0.009982603,0.022717278,0.03170809,-0.020891113,0.0043059606,0.036487047,-0.0026934305,-0.02119933,-0.02897955,0.038344774,-0.13950558,0.056847673,-0.027943403,0.060858183,0.057835862,-0.057928566,0.049493738,-0.037367787,-0.04141306,0.077254474,-0.07048741,0.08600453,0.017844304,-0.028700778,0.0020690423,0.055294316,-0.062007047,0.045193467,0.008495018,0.0039450466,-0.06346577,-0.0016719792,0.0026748066,0.08897268,0.03620555,-0.07668971,0.029063903,0.048469033,0.015423473,0.028557098,0.0381025,-0.05958451,-0.018940521,-0.04588297,0.056242798,0.04109848,-0.0030198228,0.018473338,-0.030937642,-0.0319735,-0.033642367,0.03668879,0.08810844,-0.022401284,-0.016620262,-0.028905796,-0.02643542,0.06017632,0.0020928772,0.039478388,0.07595509,0.018355891,0.031639934,0.045900725,-0.1015184,3.6887123e-33,0.039733056,-0.037048485,0.0004907934,0.08186755,0.061649658,-0.069852225,-0.047557026,-0.014305896,0.023020534,0.121379465,-0.022563137,0.08963594,-0.009099057,0.042755876,0.017205063,0.0024340455,-0.0120831765,0.032924954,-0.042183742,-0.0008493372,0.015515123,-0.10789401,-0.03424203,0.023307724,0.025652556,0.07965484,0.057642862,0.015452103,0.038787,0.023517529,0.0071494402,0.058958746,0.009293489,0.047632575,-0.016955623,-0.044297155,-0.017768446,-0.043344013,0.02853483,0.07738705,-0.021920836,-0.053964216,-0.07811495,-0.040464804,0.0042392174,0.044515584,0.0569958,-0.054194547,0.026344985,0.004059539,-0.006789353,-0.023429507,0.06443116,-0.019069117,-0.046009004,0.06332953,-0.05005743,-0.16528377,0.035534065,0.060471866,-0.056321528,0.06661188,-0.025766635,-0.0012925875,-0.06062422,0.017894832,0.009465924,0.0717389,-0.030317018,0.0155137675,-0.028198844,-0.028417444,-0.060223192,-0.0129679395,0.098108694,0.0140667055,0.016350314,0.009791251,0.042285543,-0.020972053,0.04830643,-0.03997036,0.016923498,-0.076106705,-0.05464452,-0.039391626,0.018282637,-0.018227112,-0.000111204354,-0.055861413,-0.052311417,0.028187254,-0.05073705,0.032367114,0.018110555,-4.2994613e-33,-0.066658355,0.053548552,0.030106697,0.051020198,0.027433557,-0.0075683137,-0.004455795,-0.022606447,0.12159517,-0.063861445,-0.051574793,-0.06996688,0.013588913,0.026731784,0.008525468,0.063969485,-0.026213625,-0.08260195,-0.03020062,0.017200215,-0.02423379,-0.016674718,-0.09945084,-0.060836885,-0.094370276,0.08462328,-0.07530508,-0.049640294,-0.09533586,-0.03352136,-0.0061957403,-0.0508723,-0.009787322,-0.022268014,-0.04618875,0.046377823,0.033799674,-0.10259856,-0.020465564,0.012991579,0.044831194,0.07044447,-0.05668359,0.024532124,-0.023182394,-0.041045606,0.027059276,0.06768767,0.042326994,0.022896456,-0.013897956,0.09453854,0.027003536,-0.011725336,-0.027305158,0.025478637,0.060794912,0.03172201,-0.04669059,0.122474216,0.018086487,-0.032216664,0.025353348,-0.009739691,-0.004037172,-0.060311496,0.065875955,-0.031953834,-0.04447497,-0.04634644,0.03244178,-0.015546468,-0.08798006,-0.11949824,0.017852599,-0.014706858,-0.03668983,-0.08560973,-0.0870346,0.051952668,0.06238602,-0.060033586,0.03695872,0.065346904,0.006202564,0.06768532,0.017223949,-0.011293427,0.0054435525,-0.058082953,-0.11363441,-0.0042318376,-0.10034911,0.10779808,0.014851845,-5.9122982e-08,-0.056933638,0.052522868,0.042901833,-0.035618413,0.056259863,-0.06195329,-0.006402431,0.20503944,-0.03564421,-0.015296489,0.086366564,-0.05300925,-0.17462766,0.04381778,0.1071215,-0.027878074,0.064179845,0.06371334,-0.01527438,0.04770372,0.09264184,-0.014615985,0.023987181,-0.0051247776,0.036340807,-0.052093796,0.0150920665,0.09745644,0.05037166,0.03998704,-0.020968754,-0.04599151,0.07597543,-0.03541872,0.0014179145,0.046191454,0.08452795,-0.03669685,-0.06771967,-0.0313189,-0.0522808,0.042262755,0.012883991,0.04280523,-0.030133968,0.024740571,-0.05276721,-0.00918953,0.03652618,-0.04573679,-0.01813426,-0.009762957,0.07026192,0.05763668,0.06532204,0.09767574,0.008157101,0.017453201,0.004665762,-0.010003519,0.016864058,-0.02130604,-0.061310627,-0.0006263736,4,5.876181,29.714628,6
625,"in this lecture we learnt about exploratory data analysis. this is the first step towards creating any machine learning model. eda involves cleaning, transforming, understanding and analyzing the raw data through basic and primary techniques. data can be analyzed to reveal patterns in it, if any. this can be done using either mathematical formulae or by making visual charts. also, many times we donâ€™t get a single data file, instead we have to merge a lot of files to get a compact, single data file on which we perform further analysis. 
there is crisp-dm: cross industry standard process for data mining, in which there are 6 steps to be followed for building a good ml model. 
the steps are:
1- business understanding- this involves acquiring domain knowledge, clearly defining our goal and objectives, and understanding the problems that are to be tackled by the model. 
2- data understanding- this step involves, collection, analysis, and assessment of the relevancy and quality of data.
3- data preparation- it involves cleaning and transforming data into suitable form for analysis. feature engineering is done to select the most relevant/ appropriate features.
4- modelling- after performing the data analysis and cleaning steps, we move towards fitting a basic model to our data. the model is trained based on the available data. if y-values are not available, we used unsupervised learning algorithms, to cluster the data and assign labels to it.
5- evaluation - assessment of the model performance using various metrics and implementing changes in it, if any.
6- deployment- implement the final model and monitor its performance to make improvements with time. also, effectively present the insights and results of our model.
the entire process is iterative, we need to repeat the steps again and again, as and when required.
we need to establish a certain acceptance criterion for our model. for many algorithms, we assume that the distribution of the features is normal, however this may not be the case for every x. heteroscedasticity is another problem, in which the variance of the residuals is not constant and keeps varying. 
in eda, we have to clean the data, account for the missing values and also detect the outliers and take necessary actions to handle these. 
the example we discussed in class was that of clustering patients into diabetic/ non-diabetic, by considering various features including, insulin levels, glucose levels, age, bmi, etc. these features, in the very basic step, can be analyzed using histograms, which may give us some (if not complete) idea about the distribution. we can also use correlation maps (heat maps) to find out the relation between these features. however, we cannot completely rely on these, and we should take into consideration numerous other factors as well. we looked upon matrix plot, box plots, quartile plots and some others to find the relationship in the data. the box plots, histograms can be used to detect outliers. 
it is important to know/ find out what we should do with the missing values and outliers. in some cases, it is reasonable to ignore the entire row/ observation and in some others, it is better to fill up the missing values. all this depends on the count of missing values. if there are a large number of such missing values, then completely deleting those observations, would leave us with merely 10-15 rows which is not at all sufficient to build up a model. 
for filling up the missing values we can use either mean, mode or median, depending on the level of measurement. for example, when we have nominal data, we use mode because the concept of mean is not defined for nominal data. 
the next step is to detect the outliers. there are several methods to do so. we can plot histograms, box plots and find out the points that lie far beyond the region where maximum of the points lie. dbscan- density based spatial clustering of applications with noise is yet another method used for detecting outliers. it considers a point and finds out other points around it which are in close proximity to it. likewise, it clusters all other points, thereby forming groups. the outliers remain ungrouped. 
median is not affected by the outliers, but the mean is. hence, median is preferred over mean for detecting outliers. however, in some cases, use of mean is not justifiable as it deviates largely from the values nearby the missing values. considering this as the approximate missing value would lead to larger errors. 
instead of using mean or median for filling the missing values, we can also use a regression model in that region and determine the missing values. so, even for filling the missing data and for data cleaning (eda), we use various models. this suggests that all the steps involved in building a model from the basic/ raw data are iterative and are performed in loops. 
by carrying out these repetitive operations we keep refining our model, so as to get the best possible model for our data set.

635,"sir started with how to read confusion matrix and how to interpret it. till now the data given to us was ordered and structured data. but in real data will be different. we have to understand the nature of data. we have some tools to understand data. after understanding this data we have to think and apply proper transformations so that data will be converted into a form suitable for analysis. data formats can be text, binary, files, database, from internet. crisp-dm : cross industry standard process for data mining. it has six steps running cyclically :1. business understanding 2. data understanding  3. data preparation 4. modelling 5. evaluation 6. deployment. currently we see data understanding and data preparation. don't use deep learning networks when you are not supposed to use. use the most appropriate model suitable. data understanding: collect initial data, describe data, verify data quality. data preparation: select data, clean data, construct data, integrate data, format data. eda-performing initial investigations on the data to gain insights, spot anomalies, test hypothesis and check assumptions. then sir showed a mind map about data problems and explained it. heteroscedasticity: different variance at different points of dataset. then one of the teaching assistant gave explanation about eda. diabetes data set was analysed. the features are glucose level, bmi,bp and insulin.  the output is whether a person is diabetic or not. a boxplot can help understand variability in the features and any outliers present in them. feature correlations helps us filter data better. matrix plot between can show more such relationships between the features-two at a time. we have to do time based analysis: how data evolves in time. find any underlying trend or seasonality in the data. handling missing values: missing data is shown as na. it is of three formats: missing completely at random(mcar)-completely random data points missing, missing at random(mar)-some relationships between missing point and values in different columns , missing not at random(mnar). to solve this we can just leave those missing points like that. we can replace the missing point with mean, median or mode. we can use knn, we can see the nearest points near the missing point and take their average and replace the missing value. mice-multiple imputation by chained equations. so in filling missing data we might have to use machine learning models. time series data is of particular interest because of the temporal aspects that we can utilize. forward and backward fill, linear interpolation, simple moving averages. we have to understand which method is best for which type  of missing points. handling outliers- datapoint that significantly differs from other data. detecting outliers: inter quartile range, standard deviation.  for multivariate data, dbscan- density based spatial clustering of applications with noise can be used to detect outliers. to visualise higher dimensional data we can use 2d t-sne plot(discussed in detail in further lectures). to remove outliers: data trimming and data

637,"in class we discussed the steps to be applied in data science, which are: understanding the problem, exploratory data analysis, and visualization. then we discussed about the cyclic running process called: crisp dm. it stands for ""cross industry standard process for data mining"". its six steps are: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation, deployment. we need to budget our time accordingly as we do not want to spend too much time on unimportant tasks. we need to create a project plan to judicially assign time to each of these six steps. 
later, we looked into exploratory data analysis. we saw a rigorous mind map for problems related to 'x' and 'y'. for the x part, we saw that problems can be either less features or too many features. when we have too many features we can't just go on eliminating features. there is possibility that the feature we eliminate might actually be a controlling part for the process. hence, we need to be very careful. other problems are feature scaling problem, collinearity and multicollinearity. 
later, we had a presentation by shubham. he explained his approach on the data analysis for diabetic data. he explained the problems that arose and also their solutions. he suggested a method of density based spatial clustering of application with noise (dbscan). 
later, sir cleared some points regarding outliers. we focus more on median when dealing with outliers than the mean. this is because outliers do not affect median but it affects mean.

645,"in the review of their mid-semester exam and problem-solving approach, the primary steps of exploratory data analysis (eda) were discussed, including data visualization and handling missing values. the analysis also covered the limitations in prediction accuracy due to an under-sampled target variable, ""heart diseases."" insights were drawn from histograms and heat maps, guiding the

646,"crisp-dm is the process we covered today for addressing data mining, progressing through learning about business and data, preparing it, developing models, testing them, and ultimately deploying solutions. eda allows us to play with data, identify patterns, and see problems such as insulin outliers. there isn't always random missing data, so we apply methods such as knn or mice to manage it. class imbalance can also distort results, so there are special techniques. visualization tools such as histograms and boxplots make analysis more intuitive and clearer.",-0.0036832558,-0.022003317,0.0035852364,0.013283681,-0.0041812053,-0.08283603,0.00803805,0.004216349,-0.09823867,0.065267704,-0.06573116,0.053331602,0.0130741745,-0.035616223,-0.032545976,-0.021838358,-0.00958995,-0.006020692,-0.050293785,-0.07017599,0.018397786,0.03673108,0.0007575572,0.03717777,-0.028370397,0.01480926,0.1400322,0.0062228297,-0.06475235,-0.08938484,-0.0020224694,0.040262308,0.05805877,-0.01638287,-0.0844238,0.026331319,0.037327398,0.03790223,-0.0056966804,-0.025630511,0.045737695,-0.0064007933,0.0037294782,0.10288351,0.025725666,-0.048572898,-0.16895615,-0.0419111,0.007876984,0.020245811,-0.095162936,-0.11101597,0.01565146,0.041047886,0.022726245,0.007980333,-0.012853907,-0.048158787,-0.05217575,-0.028314352,0.009531626,-0.03057998,0.013427971,0.024037395,0.07965612,-0.011904712,0.09300657,0.07103592,0.031675525,-0.039222326,0.0050171306,0.040843673,-0.10373864,0.07822041,0.03552037,0.0046125376,-0.052261397,-0.033188045,0.11440021,0.009363994,-0.029076252,0.059147544,0.0037259252,0.08953594,0.067437306,-0.016407497,0.0017218157,-0.029782198,-0.0105690425,-0.008499935,0.028714143,0.035876606,-0.03177221,0.0031112721,-0.05937771,0.049307764,0.029140886,-0.07686505,0.021930704,0.05485168,-0.020175848,0.06205148,-0.008403571,-0.010845494,-0.041783463,-0.073089756,0.07549758,0.006432305,0.007265187,0.013345597,0.007079232,0.009156566,-0.01381576,0.03362451,0.010054307,-0.056329753,0.017713564,-0.07150014,-0.044596054,0.09339189,-0.07237037,0.02232775,0.023559345,0.008231643,0.022385385,0.09572026,-0.10694942,3.5042625e-33,0.043671846,-0.07421993,-0.010400744,0.023407374,0.03211635,-0.07701385,-0.061415654,0.033550795,0.010438012,0.05699315,-0.046704963,0.07708223,0.016326834,0.1083467,0.013401102,-0.07638514,0.020732254,0.09133692,-0.012446154,0.00874169,-0.06780895,-0.04861595,0.055403955,-0.056199145,0.046373557,0.1004635,-0.02553057,0.07891034,0.15142794,0.017575102,0.013226345,-0.009568086,0.036640346,-0.032238353,-0.052424043,-0.01843395,-0.003065633,0.01255601,0.041232277,0.055853516,0.0068575107,-0.041627195,0.012173993,-0.05686591,-0.026756909,0.0813333,0.036631368,-0.024145756,0.018168567,0.017473908,0.020755848,-0.042368315,0.016351717,-0.0013464474,-0.049403023,0.060723614,-0.012845841,-0.118359886,0.036618356,0.011536756,-0.03593601,0.04739903,-0.042879462,0.007808248,-0.03262657,-0.014065649,-0.029737739,-0.034923933,-0.034886245,0.035411876,0.018356657,-0.037712224,-0.073352225,0.013082986,0.016657507,-0.0019630145,0.0132359825,0.052089717,-0.02552654,-0.055277813,0.09477492,-0.006788087,-0.0070083346,-0.07692946,-0.059694577,-0.04079856,0.019341404,-0.02587588,-0.046554405,-0.0073935483,-0.111959726,0.027343312,-0.044733014,0.017813768,0.059947137,-4.4199723e-33,-0.1258074,0.053265274,-0.017133782,0.092486024,0.028084131,0.024355238,-0.011497003,0.0036623175,0.045589264,-0.024345538,0.0059252307,0.0063352063,-0.001862623,0.03964614,0.0037292212,0.052576236,-0.055597674,-0.023412308,-0.046490256,-0.04459351,-0.006698475,0.05164214,-0.091993764,-0.048352104,-0.042228695,0.078414045,-0.10065882,0.042411584,0.006859528,-0.024688102,-0.006689921,-0.07349393,0.018725058,-0.045184076,-0.039970245,0.016407153,0.0141386725,-0.05953024,0.00071229215,0.028107807,0.028583461,0.026698584,-0.059694573,0.017369095,0.047641013,-0.03429615,0.0039193016,0.054227464,0.05286936,0.045103267,-0.0013816607,0.043604165,-0.018722827,-0.018878337,0.006771042,0.017008848,0.067228,-0.010770428,-0.04600508,0.08358949,-0.09188592,-0.053320922,-0.010332459,0.013057348,-0.057351265,-0.047775924,0.08343224,-0.063137844,-0.036539666,0.016536329,0.07539521,0.06310414,-0.051585056,-0.05517939,-0.0049784156,-0.05524757,-0.037054304,0.044424687,-0.02533517,0.0018070852,0.04846104,-0.10384757,0.04038029,0.05708092,-0.05492806,0.049961753,0.07226191,-0.087676965,-0.019564306,0.014233829,-0.09004395,0.008882859,-0.0999225,0.04761423,-0.002572976,-5.3467193e-08,0.051629484,-0.056501694,0.06331135,0.034527976,0.039399426,-0.039066155,-0.045107532,0.14977238,0.045181684,0.0033007292,0.07985464,0.02175449,-0.15258001,-0.007086663,0.13821203,0.03070929,-0.016921096,0.114114724,-0.06554437,0.05025073,-0.016187452,0.016241431,0.024000362,-0.038570434,0.08504831,-0.06438213,0.026229931,0.08220449,0.00095978205,-0.0079370625,-0.021300405,-0.019928781,0.091354735,-0.023049545,0.007889412,0.013572985,0.03968033,0.018381799,-0.07034499,0.0028387636,-0.07406694,-0.012094723,0.009733639,-0.0047369506,-0.028205577,-0.020263216,0.016018225,-0.019572247,0.067338064,-0.027738437,-0.0879864,0.024854725,0.047452323,0.00018179398,-0.033878513,0.06882058,-0.050963122,-0.0016982004,-0.008657828,0.0057298117,0.090146825,-0.054981433,-0.076140575,0.03572189,4,7.2770514,26.63406,6
667,"we studied about crisp-dm
(cross industry standard process for data mining) which has 6 steps running cyclically:-(i)business understanding-determine business objectives,(ii)data understanding-explore data,(iii)data preparation-construct data,(iv)modelling-assess model,(v)evaluation-review process and (vi) deployment-review project.
next we studied about exploratory data analysis(eda).it is an approach used in statistics and data science to analyze and investigate datasets.
then we looked at outliers and quartiles. a boxplot can help to understand variability in the features and outlier instances.
then we studied about 3 types of missing data:-(i)missing completely at random(mcar),(ii)missing at random(mar) and (iii)missing not at random(mnar)
lastly we got to know about true outliers, values that lie in the extremes but are not erroneous.",0.049430724,-0.026957937,-0.013513524,0.051313113,0.009619917,-0.04384368,-0.021302558,-0.0028624993,-0.026206333,-0.005005348,0.014419074,0.06829279,0.036211513,-0.06435628,-0.03175286,-0.073861346,-0.010787533,-0.052592874,-0.08180103,-0.10716062,-0.090596266,0.060628828,-0.032030176,0.021393664,-0.0015828637,-0.01853309,0.043523673,0.015767789,-0.04632738,-0.02775002,-0.0010466435,0.09117562,0.02733119,-0.004812528,0.028667592,0.039304372,0.024799129,0.06509322,0.026536657,-0.002050567,-0.02763529,-0.033054564,-0.016458187,0.041662864,0.05167805,-0.05955546,-0.08887307,-0.11704689,-0.038075145,-0.003943592,-0.098084144,-0.032706626,0.021199211,0.08232124,-0.015420131,-0.046101093,-0.08397384,0.00064516015,0.02262777,0.0025828152,0.038338758,-0.06393841,0.0040469687,0.001238572,0.03724753,-0.031974334,0.021176457,0.016851371,-0.010234531,-0.0093253385,-0.0047765067,0.0065805158,-0.13853613,0.08036216,-0.030305516,0.034819905,0.075848706,-0.016367221,0.0012038653,-0.027172135,-0.023479925,0.06330106,-0.09220251,0.083596446,0.019430706,-0.053226084,0.015478309,0.038496424,-0.030821104,0.07517862,0.009410698,0.032351993,-0.06546128,-0.007816859,0.06355737,0.08568104,0.03173114,-0.053411115,0.061718173,0.04543368,0.023646107,0.06507688,0.0021327853,-0.04171308,-0.04073395,-0.04961499,0.05139539,0.032685407,-0.022532009,-0.013656174,-0.0383394,-0.011850201,0.01935873,-0.04082358,0.08042687,-0.05521526,-0.018948508,-0.024263753,-0.056540534,0.066441394,-0.02453375,0.076587886,0.09892617,-0.00961278,0.0045734723,0.06319259,-0.08843996,3.9941667e-33,0.013670949,-0.05218956,0.001175932,0.06999904,0.038535435,-0.045454677,-0.022190792,-0.03103548,0.025655681,0.08731808,-0.020678854,0.042493958,-0.024120819,0.01966549,0.015683668,0.0072816117,0.037396695,0.03184907,-0.05639489,-0.021491135,0.04904654,-0.09132054,-0.027113007,0.028813286,0.05070221,0.05606088,0.07533593,0.012467603,0.031228237,0.026724992,0.025679993,0.021160893,-0.008803864,0.021499943,-0.028161753,-0.014219512,0.0018931536,-0.031195179,0.037052207,0.044344842,-0.06166689,-0.023756403,-0.062330775,-0.02925825,-0.021991465,0.05360089,0.052868992,-0.06314275,0.05752648,0.013955464,-0.012940389,-0.023510873,0.076498404,-0.011874698,-0.047876496,0.066285916,-0.02352172,-0.152239,0.0021702445,0.043725338,-0.041976944,0.050423708,-0.041422833,-0.016942518,-0.051191874,0.030595629,0.02046391,0.044527147,-0.04969475,0.004348075,-0.019136453,-0.024278028,-0.018670695,-0.0018983748,0.11043472,0.033715017,-0.0011321161,0.00076065044,0.05616317,-0.043979086,0.013463593,-0.013584774,0.044031423,-0.05084678,-0.06588777,-0.040396117,0.04131917,-0.04390146,0.014092113,-0.017143287,-0.08427633,0.059135024,-0.07905348,0.02477916,0.005925658,-4.6738743e-33,-0.064002514,0.063936315,0.020650657,0.056845773,0.0021834238,0.027794747,-0.021921271,0.011404641,0.10094973,-0.07187211,-0.04649103,-0.06291833,0.012434754,0.020420076,-0.025641918,0.08717427,0.0035076407,-0.05091689,-0.020965086,0.03594818,-0.0021352575,-0.002604886,-0.096985936,-0.04075302,-0.07336927,0.10942097,-0.0894284,-0.014526829,-0.06625739,-0.08378064,0.016437907,-0.049051166,0.010081175,-0.027372463,-0.0316947,0.0074487817,0.011432938,-0.080153935,0.010123866,0.012215631,0.02935317,0.089062706,-0.028040806,0.011367554,-0.019284438,-0.03837088,0.032346327,0.048233375,0.04021684,0.03422699,0.007533824,0.08335209,-0.0023537923,0.010081886,-0.02047028,0.01698766,0.0572553,0.0011688904,-0.08315472,0.12103277,0.011796122,-0.034925863,0.059834015,0.00079571304,-0.04862406,-0.029990517,0.073072016,-0.023920083,-0.06108619,-0.06484694,0.008608414,-0.007943034,-0.09442641,-0.11575173,0.02811011,-0.009955978,-0.04508218,-0.07086949,-0.05116904,0.015050756,0.097478054,-0.041953903,0.026945353,0.03689371,-0.004042542,0.033257894,0.023526937,-0.043949973,0.009462648,-0.067321755,-0.1307168,-0.02883717,-0.07322903,0.07218663,0.023390405,-6.124372e-08,-0.041686036,0.056316923,0.029511679,-0.0020409406,0.06488194,-0.08794955,-0.042265546,0.18326552,-0.02222228,-0.03741867,0.039344568,-0.082081944,-0.2029412,0.04662631,0.08577925,-0.007588383,0.032299533,0.0843347,-0.0072826943,0.027545167,0.066298775,0.024404453,0.014809087,-0.029679567,0.05851695,-0.014568653,-0.015149912,0.0701813,0.06539253,0.022717277,-0.010952823,-0.021204207,0.11233874,-0.021947216,-0.058645308,0.05219989,0.066099145,-0.031801,-0.08394503,-0.0005295887,-0.04466991,0.014468186,0.008906322,0.028299134,-0.04782216,0.0031449418,-0.075963505,0.016809182,0.04043994,-0.042385902,0.005664712,0.009939232,0.1095698,0.07069126,0.052321043,0.10543108,0.036931306,0.03538082,-0.00033982957,-0.024715157,0.024969434,-0.050767355,-0.068504184,0.04541352,4,5.974774,29.856907,6
