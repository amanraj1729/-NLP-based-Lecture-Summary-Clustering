45,"in today's class, we started with the discussion on metrics which determines the quality of logistics regression or classification. the score or accuracy is not a good metric in some cases, instead f1-score is better than accuracy. then we discussed the roc graph (receiver operating characteristic curve), plot between tp rate and fp rate. auc(area under the curve) of this plot tells about the quality of classification. if auc is near 1, then classification is good; whereas when auc is near 0.5, there is no or worst classification. after that, we discussed how to calculate precision and recall for a given classification problem from it's confusion matrix. in ml, a regression problem can be solved with classification, but the converse need not to be true.
clustering is usually done on unsupervised data. we discussed two types of clustering algorithms 1. k-means clustering and 2. hierarchical clustering. sir also explained the method by which both algorithms work. in k-means, we have to predecide the number of clusters whereas hierarchical does not need to predefine number of clusters. hierarchical clustering uses tree like structure known as dendrogram. we also discussed linkages related to hierarchical clustering.

68,"true positive rate vs fast positive rate plot for different thresholds is called receiver operating characteristics curve. for random guess model, this curve is y=x. area under this curve should be as close to 1 for good classification models.

classification problems when data labels are not available is clustering problem where model have to find clusters in dataset, one cluster means same label points.
in k-means clustering algorithm, initially k clusters are assigned randomly and cluster centers are iteratively updated based on distance from data points until cluster center stops changing.

hierarchical clustering starts with each data point as a separate cluster. gradually, the nearest clusters or points are merged step by step until all points form a single cluster. this merging process is visually represented using a dendrogram, where making a horizontal cut at any level reveals a possible clustering structure with a specific number of groups.",0.009363827,-0.06614242,-0.019483779,-0.01995419,0.029492998,-0.06371181,-0.009782536,-0.007900127,0.10130804,-0.024346413,0.074728124,-0.047469813,0.04032591,0.00037794546,-0.021738768,-0.062050905,0.09391153,-0.048179377,-0.014287939,-0.0589607,0.031246912,-0.037585665,-0.005449427,0.066409215,-0.0004632137,-0.034380585,0.025049102,0.013677328,0.014338716,-0.047715228,-0.038212452,0.034724426,0.10153556,0.04165327,-0.057393298,0.051786505,-0.0019397772,0.032366086,-0.029859673,0.057867426,-0.029973017,-0.0020136088,0.0052709854,-0.00046514827,-0.012214801,0.047947377,-0.055579375,0.028578738,-0.103352614,0.014483431,0.00031155045,0.0122909155,-0.02574007,0.04988325,-0.040782645,0.047772266,0.008476314,0.0021265228,0.026485864,0.043483116,0.072437674,-0.083594404,-0.0018910798,-0.041714728,0.106414825,0.03723594,0.049491204,0.034007296,0.07410445,-0.037169203,0.053479906,0.03126544,0.0013583362,0.030439382,-0.05129176,0.010717913,0.03034592,0.048789605,-0.0141532095,-0.04477393,0.0020598995,0.0754801,-0.01856695,0.008420464,0.030985614,-0.00033749733,0.012691387,-0.01609106,-0.046615694,-0.0017997961,-0.060777433,0.01523628,-0.09170271,-0.08101388,-0.07457889,-0.012099124,0.0031318723,-0.027945805,0.09267744,0.006299932,-0.012392855,-0.013432391,0.050717384,-0.058414444,0.036791515,-0.04371365,-0.0020468535,0.0027373629,0.08044359,0.03670405,-0.053237054,0.011502014,-0.067867056,0.034265827,0.0010580047,0.02556495,0.0767838,-0.0108089335,-0.087362796,-0.0021198473,-0.035869915,-0.07151278,-0.011343172,-0.020368395,0.045465693,0.0787072,-0.101994954,8.3299056e-33,-0.03429354,-0.07018005,0.01662522,-0.110414475,0.009861057,-0.056528695,-0.12459331,0.012238692,0.043554448,0.022532452,0.009227263,0.01438858,0.069009885,0.02219072,0.067744374,-0.08594607,0.021696333,0.049849324,-0.09640362,-0.07640469,-0.006826788,-0.019251682,0.041306864,-0.040858164,-0.0021529188,0.011513213,-0.0355841,-0.042777434,0.020277714,0.0062546665,-0.042185362,0.041553155,-0.010061913,0.007500493,0.025202978,0.070734985,0.006274382,-0.03471021,-0.004588644,-0.08126011,-0.06625203,-0.01812041,0.022505777,-0.054015663,0.048055332,0.042467847,0.0065364884,-0.08436863,-0.04620626,0.0005777881,-0.008944744,-0.08339323,0.008683012,0.021932013,0.005167351,0.12260213,0.027687628,-0.029071014,-0.027803216,0.09106426,0.010137152,-0.08574647,-0.01348901,-0.03894058,-0.023361236,-0.02507983,0.02216156,0.07392122,0.1053282,0.059374545,-0.012557123,0.07194378,-0.03634101,0.013049868,-0.03256722,0.030157533,-0.013481377,0.06399956,-0.021509634,0.007943435,-0.08492811,-0.08278206,-0.07711672,-0.09387637,0.0034828074,0.002930075,0.056686476,-0.0025206702,-0.09093256,0.0065766945,-0.10049942,0.0828036,0.08468741,0.065425284,-0.027002575,-9.955228e-33,-0.064654514,0.036042407,-0.010647101,0.07008753,-0.026669448,0.050210454,-0.051830947,0.07818862,0.00800296,0.004756442,-0.06107109,0.034606725,0.014457024,-0.0023322005,-0.015531104,0.002274337,0.010344322,0.05827865,0.06517752,-0.0023182265,-0.0048203417,0.011663319,-0.07547794,-0.033533964,0.030697225,0.051335838,-0.08983312,0.03404884,-0.04933658,0.010047788,-0.05153357,-0.0011598928,-0.028677134,-0.0028855002,0.00470659,-0.050614633,-0.0061323717,-0.07364047,0.02797738,-0.040668644,0.0003524433,0.08003244,-0.055169407,-0.031954054,-0.008216653,-0.060135912,0.023130042,0.05164518,-0.02956939,-0.035387143,0.0015127698,-0.011017402,0.0007975852,0.090267316,-0.06322714,0.05192518,-0.05162576,0.030256625,-0.038931493,0.053048704,-0.058585882,-0.06900868,-0.029375061,0.049589064,-0.048446238,-0.14542891,0.09514042,-0.03881755,-0.030384518,0.0698363,0.020191818,0.12073444,0.017138632,0.014557106,-0.05329773,-0.10286717,-0.030802852,-0.026250632,-0.053981286,-0.10580793,-0.043635283,-0.022915622,-0.028816251,0.040076345,0.0436666,-0.012290661,0.023159478,0.025434427,0.09185563,-0.013344353,0.030496996,0.011633147,-0.030505527,0.095724575,-0.068422034,-5.5434427e-08,0.037379544,-0.06387809,0.0012399036,-0.051815864,0.10330626,0.068986244,-0.056491636,0.12817332,-0.053044386,-0.04817004,0.09366709,-0.0020056567,-0.16340163,-0.02791423,0.01004901,-0.00383641,0.036456335,0.053683534,-4.5039606e-06,0.041082513,-0.047204096,-0.055947095,0.0113707865,0.07550871,0.0015761728,-0.025888968,0.07234206,0.06283473,-0.053989917,-0.03480183,-0.047236815,0.025188861,0.011957318,0.102063276,0.05292003,0.11484535,-0.064164944,0.067440055,-0.03405454,0.06729569,0.022548893,-0.011025546,-0.034471832,-0.029940702,0.01830258,0.0864969,0.07518058,-0.006592638,0.037961382,0.043547098,-0.022692733,0.03777671,-0.04447547,-0.009861787,-0.0062254,0.03155008,-0.05886997,-0.07976028,0.05070722,0.046130378,0.09792238,-0.04082601,-0.023089204,-0.04768658,7,12.456821,-29.505777,4
76,today we continued discussing about logistic regression the class began with the  demonstration of artificial neural networks and we learnt that selecting appropriate and relevant number of features is very important. we then revisited the logistic regression metrices and a new metric was introduced today and that was roc graph which tells us that how many true positives did the model predict before predicting the false positives and for a good model which can make a boundary between two clusters then the area under the curve must be close to 1 if the data is not good and if there is too much overlap of the data then in such cases the area under the curve will be close to 0.5. we then saw two examples of logistic regression one showing how to interpret the metrices like accuracy. precision and confusion matrix. we looked at another example where there were four clusters in the data but one had class imbalance and we could clearly see in the roc curve that specific class had very low area under the curve. we looked at clustering methods mainly k-means and hierarchical clustering. the main difference between these two is that we have to specify  number of cluster we want in k-means but the hierarchical clustering considers every data point as a cluster and then starts making broader groups. k-means works on taking the n-means and then starts calculating the euclidean distance between other points which ever is close to the nth mean it is classified into that cluster. hierarchical clustering uses indivdual points as a cluster and then finds which element is close to it forms a bigger cluster with that now distance between this cluster and other cluster is calculated and which ever is smaller is taken in to form a bigger

89,"the session started with a quick review of the gradient descent function and then moved into logistic regression. the professor explained the confusion matrix and showed a website where you could experiment with neural network clustering. after that, students explored logistic regression code and learned about key metrics like precision, recall, and the f1 score. the roc curve was also introduced, with the false positive rate (fpr) on the x-axis and the true positive rate (tpr) on the y-axis, and it was mentioned that each class has its own curve. the session finished with a look at clustering methods, starting with k-means, where the number of clusters is set in advance, and ending with hierarchical clustering.

93,"in the lecture, we began by exploring a website called playground.tensorflow.org, which allows users to interactively experiment with machine learning models. on this site, we could select a dataset, choose features, and configure the number and size of hidden layers in the neural network. by pressing the ""run"" button, we could start training the model and observe how each neuron affects the final classification. this provided a clear visual understanding of machine learning processes and helped us build an intuition for model behavior. an interesting point was that even with a single hidden layer and appropriate features, we were able to achieve high classification accuracy on challenging datasets.

next, we discussed logistic regression. in the example code, we didn't implement a train-test split, which is something we should always do to evaluate the model's performance more reliably. we used python's logistic regression library to train the model and evaluated it using the `score` function, which in the case of logistic regression refers to the modelâ€™s accuracy, unlike in linear regression, where it corresponds to the r-squared value. 

we also covered the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve, which is a graphical representation of a model's performance. the roc curve plots the true positive rate (tpr) against the false positive rate (fpr). a good classifier will classify most examples correctly before starting to make mistakes, which results in a steep increase in tpr with a minimal increase in fpr. we explained that for two classes, we can assume 2d gaussian distributions, each with different means. when the distributions are well separated, the overlap is minimal, leading to fewer misclassifications. however, when the distributions are less well separated, thereâ€™s more overlap, increasing the chance of classification errors. the model calculates the probability of each classification, and by adjusting the threshold, we can compute different tpr and fpr values, which form the roc curve. if the area under the roc curve is 1, the classifier is considered perfect.

following this, we explored multiclass classification. in this case, we calculated the precision, recall, and f1 score for each class. if one of the classes showed particularly low precision, recall, or f1 score, it suggested that the dataset was imbalanced, with too few instances of that class. we also generated multiple roc curves, one for each class, to evaluate the performance across all categories.

the lecture then shifted to clustering, a form of unsupervised learning where we only have feature data (x) and no target variable (y). we learned about key clustering algorithms, such as k-means and hierarchical clustering, and the importance of clustering metrics to evaluate how well the data points are grouped.

in k-means clustering, the number of clusters, k, must be specified beforehand. the algorithm starts by randomly selecting k initial cluster centers. each data point is then assigned to the nearest center, forming the initial clusters. the centers are recalculated as the mean of the points in each cluster, and the process repeats iteratively until the cluster centers no longer change, indicating convergence.

hierarchical clustering, on the other hand, does not require predefining the number of clusters. instead, it focuses on the distance between clusters using a method called linkage. there are several types of linkage, such as single, complete, average, and wardâ€™s method, which define how the distance between clusters is measured. in hierarchical clustering, the process begins with each data point as its own individual cluster. the two clusters with the smallest distance between them are merged, and this process continues iteratively. eventually, all the points are combined into a single cluster. a key feature of hierarchical clustering is that it can be represented visually through a dendrogram, a tree-like diagram that shows the sequence of merges. by cutting the dendrogram at different levels, we can obtain different numbers of clusters and visually inspect how the data points are grouped. this gives us the flexibility to explore clusters at various levels of granularity.

in conclusion, the lecture covered foundational concepts in machine learning, including model evaluation through accuracy and roc curves, as well as clustering techniques like k-means and hierarchical clustering. these topics laid the groundwork for understanding how unsupervised and supervised learning methods work in

130,"today's lecture started with a discussion regarding an amazing website called as playground.tensroeflow.org where we can adjust the features and hidden layers so as to classify various types of datasets and make our model flexible. then we looked into a jupyter notebook where we used logistic regression to train our model and use it for classification. prof told that to never believe the accuracy blindly as it can sometimes mislead us. for evaluation of the correctness of our model we can use various other metrics like precision, recall, confusion matrix, true positive rate, false positive rate, etc. then we discussed about when can a classifier classify the data into the wrong class. one of the reasons behind this could be the overlap between the classes int the dataset. at the end, we shifted our talk towards k mean clustering.

135,"todayâ€™s session was a great mix of hands-on exploration and theory. we started by playing around with playground.tensorflow.org, tweaking the number of layers in a neural network to see how it affects performance. as we increased the degree of freedom, the model became more flexible and adapted better to the datasetâ€”until we pushed it too far and saw overfitting, where the model started memorizing patterns instead of generalizing them.

moving on to classification, we discussed the confusion matrix and broke down key terms like true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. we also saw how overlapping false positives and false negatives can make classification tricky. this naturally led us to the roc curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) and why the area under the curve (auc) matters. we learned that:

auc close to 1 means a great classifier.
auc around 0.5 (a straight diagonal line) means the model is no better than random guessing.
a key takeaway was that in real-life scenarios, data imbalance is a big challenge. for example, in fraud detection, fraudulent transactions are rare compared to normal ones, so the model often fails to detect them. thatâ€™s why accuracy alone isnâ€™t a reliable metric, and we should focus on precision, recall, and the confusion matrix instead.

shifting gears, we explored unsupervised learning and looked at k-means clusteringâ€”how data points are randomly assigned to clusters, centroids are calculated, and points are re-grouped iteratively. we also got introduced to hierarchical clustering and dendrograms, where we focused on complete linkage as a clustering method.

to wrap things up, we saw a python implementation that plotted roc curves, helping us visualize how well a classifier performs.

overall, this session gave us a clearer understanding of how classification models work, how to evaluate them properly, and how clustering helps in unsupervised learning. a great mix of concepts and application!",-0.065804765,-0.06361575,-0.025488634,0.012472294,0.10217514,-0.010018169,0.028876808,0.08957097,0.043977566,0.013469898,-0.06235927,0.020772152,-0.009770777,0.020056108,-0.07364763,-0.087810636,0.004736948,0.011441126,-0.08592822,0.042131685,-0.0034789923,-0.0091030905,0.020657027,0.042275686,-0.06270366,-0.015570312,-0.033454586,-0.07888198,-0.048260957,-0.06694698,-0.0061940206,0.060929574,0.03295167,0.021565817,-0.08950046,-0.042287324,0.013943643,0.040256985,-0.004931798,-0.029965749,-0.0066793715,-0.05800235,-0.01344126,0.042986486,0.043286636,0.007319147,0.010491431,-0.039651513,0.021729259,0.045761127,-0.05139002,0.004576896,-0.05042404,0.024029585,-0.08937668,0.027288638,0.019643594,0.04398636,-0.0634009,0.009642342,-0.009668641,-0.09135235,0.027205233,-0.031322166,0.041363105,-0.0145345135,-0.058166426,0.012029013,0.07479145,0.07507377,0.031206805,-0.0024764335,-0.04151495,0.015342642,0.041373957,0.056975063,0.049696214,0.024410218,0.02912101,0.060099315,-0.0020777998,0.027332993,0.0295685,-0.0010963749,0.12063135,-0.06598078,-0.017306257,-0.017304651,0.01838364,-0.011552244,0.06442867,-0.01398302,0.045811698,-0.05200644,0.09017581,0.045278244,-0.027828021,-0.0066097495,-0.020584011,0.0537674,-0.009699421,0.099948764,0.0058958186,-0.017366467,0.089809485,-0.02005271,0.006540239,-0.0022713079,0.06936263,-0.054191824,-0.021837432,0.060434315,0.004421578,-0.06668553,0.07988104,0.0015469536,-0.022679374,0.04008417,-0.03790467,0.118183516,-0.076874495,0.01926561,-0.01278411,0.049069203,0.015791778,0.029235879,-0.14388934,6.0934406e-33,-0.07219622,0.040739447,0.013353727,0.018338846,-0.01020768,-0.048948843,-0.056959033,-0.0052789007,0.07783339,0.09863873,-0.00015620064,0.11926776,0.014635031,0.06298799,0.0113180475,-0.014829264,-0.10173329,-0.05079391,-0.028005343,-0.02923682,0.04911939,-0.086182,0.067218445,0.011805128,0.0031257677,0.016752513,-0.03564598,0.045203853,0.016463445,0.00620145,-0.05848897,-0.02341626,0.027432438,-0.037342,0.043009046,0.028563848,0.0033807638,-0.056170877,-0.017488005,-0.02116181,-0.11167717,0.02065063,-0.0026256007,-0.014817511,-0.0017603057,0.015415312,0.04413216,-0.020419793,-0.08122718,-0.022205386,-0.01478772,-0.029020004,0.010567607,0.0387668,0.003174166,0.029489255,-0.017181948,-0.0074446155,-0.06070785,0.03871097,0.042271383,-0.052265644,-0.03243083,0.011480361,-0.07662534,-0.0013643997,0.023452347,0.08396109,-0.001960839,0.028584717,-0.020462237,0.05240869,-0.11557391,-0.06290169,0.0049463427,0.0033035537,0.07600258,0.006266796,-0.0049034622,-0.018936846,-0.058228713,0.011140803,0.065820955,-0.058353603,-0.094992444,0.024833415,0.07325313,-0.036080554,-0.051428363,0.055219755,-0.06082396,-0.0033848817,0.09237,0.083025664,-0.043725174,-5.2745853e-33,-0.08953005,-0.06984453,-0.07531542,0.026756607,-0.05171885,-0.01123961,0.042838417,0.039121997,-0.033869166,-0.031233644,0.0076236906,0.05060779,0.03229496,0.005090861,0.010263835,-0.07885372,0.014908182,0.059944015,0.049935717,-0.035757918,0.038475297,0.1159887,-0.12320582,-0.03078348,-0.07191859,0.08740396,-0.11151247,0.029181344,-0.013256868,-0.032888766,-0.06593903,0.060907476,0.023985703,0.06270672,0.028055687,0.03473362,0.019522084,-0.018128056,0.00053966296,0.08761574,-0.0067584408,0.09529588,-0.10351496,-0.02650135,-0.048552427,-0.006351016,-0.037957937,0.109015495,0.06656861,-0.009633206,0.04131964,-0.008430308,-0.011675762,0.018562289,-0.020114934,0.0593281,-0.006978705,-0.044281483,-0.02069099,0.13473316,-0.06759432,0.05732646,-0.041155156,-0.023671478,-0.034350533,-0.029994763,-0.0011719214,0.058352105,-0.014207515,0.0036616316,-0.017478911,0.028956303,-0.052281898,0.0020097143,-0.022489969,0.0030630827,-0.017316438,-0.0119217355,-0.046058916,-0.06803515,-0.04241189,-0.046344426,0.02156911,0.056476172,-0.0053096735,0.10897208,0.03649574,0.05814322,0.043965533,0.0008953569,-0.04002829,-0.013945089,-0.09130826,0.051095806,-0.031746835,-6.264536e-08,-0.03828786,0.08359826,0.046926986,-0.02611529,0.034187485,-0.007466196,-0.008820251,0.11960546,-0.07454666,0.07933865,0.060188383,-0.011657626,-0.11723737,-0.029321095,0.052061405,0.061005913,-0.0294177,0.06083921,-0.00063418417,0.03682249,0.059517,-0.054963622,-0.054275542,-0.032813698,0.04630983,-0.08964108,0.010246167,0.14330107,-0.051760398,-0.0045867423,-0.03382861,-0.049985994,0.015002744,0.030847384,0.037722703,0.10936277,0.038959302,-0.07801314,-0.07679644,0.056224987,-0.069511384,0.048715904,0.02312354,-0.008859098,-0.053196456,-0.009746692,-0.041190755,-0.007497356,-0.010242681,0.00031385297,0.0059027416,0.043258432,-0.02150125,0.0852216,0.06246206,-0.0082318885,-0.024209242,-0.03466345,-0.09282787,0.09844062,0.059595544,-0.047789827,-0.07365289,-0.008647057,7,7.927432,-33.25396,4
180,"receiver operating characteristic curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate for varying values of the threshold that is used to assign the class label based on the probabilities output by the machine learning model. the line with a slope of 1 represents no model or the output achieved by purely guessing the class label. the area under this curve is known as auc and it should be close to 1 for a good classifier, whereas it is 0.5 for the random guesses.
clustering is used when we just have the data points and no corresponding labels. k-means clustering initially assigns each point to one of the k classes randomly. then assuming these labels to be true, we find the mean or representative of the classes. and then we reassign points to classes based on their similarity (distance) to the means. this process is repeated until there are no reassignments. another method is hierarchical clustering where initially each point is its own cluster. then the closest points or clusters are joined / combined into one cluster. this process is repeated until only one cluster is left withh all the data points. then a dendrogram is used to represent this process, and any horizontal cut will define one possibility for the number of clusters. note that in k-means clustering, the number of clusters (k) needs to be given as an input to the machine learning model /

202,"we explored neural networks for classification on playground.tensorflow.org, focusing on performance metrics like precision, accuracy, recall, and f1-score. we analyzed true positive (tp) and false positive (fp) rates, noting that accuracy is calculated as:

we examined classification challenges using two overlapping distributions, highlighting misclassification in the intersection region. the quality of a classifier was discussed using roc curves, where a sharper curve indicates a better classifier, while a 45â° line represents a random classifier. auc (area under the roc curve) was introduced as a measure of classifier performance, with auc = 1 being ideal and auc = 0.5 meaning no classification ability.

we also started exploring unsupervised learning, introducing clustering techniques like k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering, where labels are not required.",0.005257596,-0.08289994,-0.033842612,0.03809085,0.087204084,0.014262779,-0.012800787,-0.003933375,-0.06120707,-0.04994199,-0.043493733,-0.06463645,-0.0032103444,0.08516662,-0.1003603,-0.07572849,0.06936206,0.031340715,-0.013823539,0.011697083,-0.005718051,0.019522695,0.0868917,0.069679275,-0.006340851,-0.007052424,-0.018176464,-0.055747107,-0.041531187,-0.01628381,0.0344868,0.0069826907,0.033562187,0.029078081,-0.041672476,0.009486398,-0.010051623,0.045631208,-0.0014939009,-0.03614187,0.006156366,-0.064175725,0.020164955,-0.002755026,0.057560112,0.06682577,-0.03221304,-0.00064961537,-0.0049248077,0.0059411824,0.032048196,0.027393796,-0.05984703,0.010477116,-0.11792944,0.10427898,0.06301026,-0.00793011,-0.028861597,-0.016461179,0.0062120548,-0.1057636,0.048200265,0.0065356283,0.015279726,0.029325496,-0.02991752,0.042056963,0.08500543,0.0066816234,0.060475364,0.055522658,-0.027205536,0.08671246,0.044034418,0.05422173,0.06118138,0.04451755,0.046219457,0.061483327,-0.0032033501,-0.00394092,-0.023339571,0.010392265,0.13933794,-0.006853331,0.016120883,0.006101005,-0.02431213,-0.01226405,0.009767404,0.019333825,0.028465273,-0.06673938,-0.019332306,-0.00045837273,0.027146388,-0.09527394,-0.023833267,0.051662546,-0.07704488,0.028434677,-0.0038387957,-0.07282308,0.07426193,0.05148415,0.018317929,0.0029179982,0.07948773,-0.00832556,0.035982724,0.0061917547,-0.05366605,-0.046614747,0.05898866,0.03600706,0.049155835,0.035770215,-0.019427676,0.10364438,-0.09366105,-0.0022352992,0.0292719,0.025315812,0.067018524,-0.012532413,-0.110462464,5.9374848e-33,-0.08384108,-0.06356349,0.021195741,-0.052732993,0.048033115,-0.061164115,-0.049641587,0.029647253,0.07031888,0.03529589,0.006767803,0.10582228,0.025547,0.06863508,0.10143889,-0.03018848,-0.011351948,-0.013676895,-0.067821525,-0.09109761,-0.011143035,-0.035455626,0.07428245,-0.015601128,-0.007472236,0.035289746,-0.043021157,0.016372593,0.004358213,0.0055549354,-0.08897209,-0.0459778,0.006461604,-0.023194268,0.08192113,0.031514198,0.009412994,-0.038685203,-0.0097984,0.00831341,-0.07550566,-0.008612836,0.02962658,-0.07666641,-0.023566436,-0.04327864,0.03166493,0.003174203,0.008571235,-0.01996486,-0.01423862,-0.082760684,-0.016665041,-0.007488636,-0.0025948402,0.03456402,0.024004083,0.056769516,-0.01324534,0.054792527,0.022344869,-0.034807276,-0.03174312,0.0125134345,-0.078435466,-0.05203445,0.024593627,0.15459275,0.06059283,0.0064163525,0.015212284,0.05580642,-0.028259238,0.023157053,0.022645362,0.053142447,0.07535994,0.021804586,-0.022979049,0.0043164925,-0.0527437,-0.056158625,-0.033490945,-0.048719864,-0.068480924,0.04186785,0.050109457,-0.002471213,-0.02447522,0.045262877,-0.08412534,0.024002342,0.07692715,0.032412596,-0.07944326,-4.6646015e-33,-0.06501753,0.0127169285,-0.079752535,0.06522759,-0.015675943,0.032660916,0.00033433348,0.06564777,-0.011811655,0.014296423,-0.013575969,0.03403877,0.01418547,-0.037557114,-0.01921517,-0.02009566,-0.04360668,0.07750813,0.04998396,0.028835196,0.017898476,0.07528442,-0.043283027,-0.0343968,-0.06928205,0.06378172,-0.07445655,0.020869901,-0.06787983,0.019719366,0.0075896336,0.020752909,0.0011421238,0.037338965,0.052261997,-0.024984833,0.034586653,-0.05164383,0.013372164,0.043653578,0.038273636,0.07056687,-0.10979851,-0.02322665,-0.033870645,-0.022609686,-0.02082773,0.073280565,-0.008005488,-0.021514785,-0.0365427,-0.030839028,-0.036636483,0.00050357153,-0.064264655,0.019333422,0.00093152205,-0.043150242,0.01482596,0.084513344,-0.030194744,0.018885057,-0.019116228,0.03203431,-0.050760396,-0.11940237,-0.028397918,0.07369989,-0.045813464,0.049530003,-0.019866912,0.033730976,0.012047615,-0.04437524,-0.12456154,0.018578926,0.03997244,0.03396939,0.027942732,-0.07537001,-0.006689627,-0.03926225,-0.03265004,0.07180095,0.043521896,0.085996635,0.032684613,0.04341016,0.119165875,0.039467808,0.0037254728,0.084635444,-0.016968912,0.04810505,-0.03210206,-5.0741715e-08,-0.025728663,0.048615545,0.038730178,-0.02268719,-0.0143920705,0.054027822,-0.063739546,0.09191697,-0.12215145,0.013919766,0.055287436,-0.02799404,-0.17032555,-0.033003937,-0.011660205,0.021320203,0.022742206,0.12484275,-0.0025309057,-0.014802744,0.029075371,-0.030450717,0.02974278,0.010240643,-0.05412563,-0.08942216,0.020891631,0.04600754,-0.023672368,-0.05309888,-0.05818644,-0.031290147,0.0008865579,-0.005860471,0.059148014,0.17317557,-0.034753338,-0.025224335,-0.09271098,0.09848797,-0.06921153,0.10024795,-0.035690255,-0.03183658,-0.04805599,-0.00025408584,0.021491535,-0.029209364,0.025816338,-0.030157493,-0.0013742171,0.026277032,-0.10205896,0.027576556,0.016785746,0.0446988,-0.08432993,-0.113448955,-0.05718636,0.04166623,0.053799383,-0.040887028,-0.04676852,0.0021513274,7,8.432534,-31.231773,4

we started with understanding the matrix where we first implemented the code and through the algorithm what's the confusion matrix understanding the values of true positive true negative false positive falls negative then precision where we discussed that we should not depend on the accuracy by the model which is inbuilt in the libraries. 
we also had a short discussion about the neural networks i that was shown by the sir on playground.tensorflow.org where we learn about various boundaries over fitting features edition of neuron sedition of players and how does it affect the output of our model. 
then we started discussing about the region of conversions curve to understand a good classifier and a bad classifier where we also use the website and understood when that the features were added it became a very good classifier the region of convergence should be steep in the starting and then saturating the area under curve of roc curve is also a metric when it reaches the value 1, it is a very good classifier while when approximately 0.5, it's very bad. a 45 degrees slope of roc is a very bad classifier. next we went to understand data imbalance which is caused due to lack of data which cannot be easily separated which is usually understood and frauds in finances and other examples to. the other two matrix at we discussed a recall and support. 
next we started understanding the on un-supervising algorithm clustering where the output y in y=f(x) is also not given. this form of learning is used when we have to cluster all the input and analyse the groups terror than giving some significance earlier.
the example used here was of e-commerce website analysing about good buyers, bad buyers, etc.
the last part discuss was two types of clustering k-means clustering (pre-determining the number of clusters and than it will form the points in the group based on centroid distance of all points) and hierarchial clustering (which uses euclidean distance to match the points and based on our set threshold, a point to cut we get the

214,"in todayâ€™s class we visit a website named â€œplayground.tensorflow.orgâ€ in which we play among the number of layers or neurons and features to see what kind of classification does it do. next we see some codes related to logistic regression, we see that we canâ€™t rely on just score or accuracy of the model. we have to compare the elements of confusion matrices to see whether it is good model or not. in the code we see two new terms 1) true positive rate - it is calculated as tp / (tp + fn), where tp is the number of true positive and fn is the number of false negative instances.
2)false positive rate - it is calculated as fp/fp+tn, where fp is the number of false positives and tn is the number of true negatives.
next we learnt about the receiver operating characteristics curve (roc) - it tell us that when does the classifier start detecting incorrect false positive. it refers the quality of classifier. for a good classifier the curve should be straight, if the curve gets flatter then it meant that the classifier is randomly classifying without any mathematical function.
we would like a classifier that discriminates between the classes even if it is overlapping. the other part of roc curve is area under curve(auc), it should be close to 1 for a good classifier. if it is close to 0.5 then it is not a good classifier. next we see an example of an imbalanced datasets where we calculate precision, recall value for class 3. other than the precision and recall, support represents the number of actual occurrences of a class in a datasets. examples of imbalance datasets is fraudulent or scams. interesting things is that we can convert regression problem into classification problem by creating bins but vice versa is not possible as it cause data losses. we see the unsupervised method of classification which is â€œclusteringâ€. k-means and hierarchical clusterings are two which we discuss. in k-means we have to specify the number of clusters but in hierarchical clustering we donâ€™t have to specify such things. in hierarchical clustering every data points is assigned to its own unique

220,"a confusion matrix is a fundamental tool for evaluating a classifier's performance, displaying the counts of true positives (tp), false positives (fp), true negatives (tn), and false negatives (fn). it helps compute key performance metrics such as precision (tp / (tp + fp)), which measures correctness among positive predictions, and recall (tp / (tp + fn)), indicating how well the model identifies actual positives. the f1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, balances both metrics.

data imbalance, where one class significantly outnumbers others, can distort model performance, often requiring techniques like resampling (oversampling or undersampling) to balance the dataset.

in unsupervised learning, clustering is used to group similar data points. k-means clustering partitions data into k clusters using centroids, while hierarchical clustering builds a nested hierarchy

232,"the lecture continued on the lines of logistic regression and classification ideas, from where we left off. we started off by discussing the error metrics and the confusion matrix. then we were given a demonstration on some sample data on â€˜playground.tensorflow.orgâ€™, which allowed us to play around with data and neural networks. it allowed us to add features to our classification problem. then we moved on to some code for logistic regression. we understood that the score function for a logistic regression model library gives us the accuracy, which we should not believe. we also plotted the confusion matrix for the data, and understood the true positives and true negatives. we then studied the reciever operating characteristics (roc) curve. the roc curve rose vertically at the start and then became horizontal. this should us that for the given dataset, our model first detected all the true positives before starting to detect false positives. ideally, the roc curve is usually shaped in a crescent shape. the roc curve indicates the quality of the classifier, where a sharper roc curve indicates a better model. the logistic_regression function returns the predicted class for an observation, or the probability value associated with it. hence, by changing the threshold between the classes, we can change the quality of the model and check it using the roc curve. the 45 degree line on the roc curve tells us that there is no classification between the points. hence, the flatter the roc curve for our classifier, the worse is our classification model. we also measure the area under the roc curve and call it as auc. for a good classifier, this value is close to 1. the worst classifier is the one with the roc curve the same as the 45 degrees line. hence the worst case auc value is 0.5. the points on the roc curve correspond to different threshold values for the classification. 
we then moved on to data having more than 2 classes, and we realised that sometimes, due to lack of anomalous data, we might not be able to use our classifier. in the entire system of the classifier, some classes may have very low f1-score, which means that they are under-represented and the classifier canâ€™t be relied on for classification of data into that class. each class has itâ€™s own roc curve, and hence a classifier can be good for one class, while being equally bad for another, which can be seen using the roc curve of that class for our classifier. 
then we moved on to clustering, which was a part of unsupervised learning. in this case, our data does not have any labels, and we need to assign labels to the data ourselves based on some characteristics. this assignment becomes a part of eda. we then studied about some clustering algorithms like hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering. for k-means clustering, we need to give the number of clusters as the input, which is difficult to find out just based on visualisation of data. however, in hierarchical clustering, we plot a dendogram and then based on that, we can decide the number of clusters we need. 
in k-means clustering, we first specify the number of desired clusters. then the algorithm starts randomly assigning points to any cluster, and then we find the centroid of each cluster. then we find the distance of each point in a cluster to the centroid of all the clusters. then we reassign each point based on the centroid they are closest to. this process repeats until each point is closest to the centroid of its cluster than any other cluster. it is an o(n^2) algorithm. in this algorithm, the initial assignment also changes our final results. hence, we run the algorithm multiple times and check that for each point, which set was it clustered into multiple times, and hence we decide the final cluster it belongs to. 
hierarchical clustering does not require any initial cluster number. it results in a dendogram, which can help us decide our degree of clustering. it starts by assigning each point as a different cluster. it then gets grouped with other clusters and we get the dendogram. the number of clusters can be decided by where we observe the dendogram. the pair wise distance between each pair of clusters is calculated, and those clusters are grouped, whose distance is less than all the other pairwise distances of those clusters. this goes on till we have just one cluster, giving us the dendogram, and the number of clusters is decided by where we cut the graph.

264,"during this session, we explored key concepts in model evaluation and clustering techniques. we began with understanding the roc curve, a graphical tool for assessing classifier performance by plotting the true positive rate (tpr) against the false positive rate (fpr). tpr (or sensitivity/recall) is defined as the ratio of correctly classified positives to the total actual positives, while fpr is the ratio of negatives incorrectly classified as positive to the total actual negatives. by varying the decision threshold, different tpr and fpr values are obtained, which form the roc curve. a perfect classifier achieves an immediate vertical jump to (0,1) with an auc of 1.0, whereas a poor modelâ€™s roc curve follows the diagonal with an auc near 0.5.
additionally, the auc, which ranges from 0 to 1, summarizes model performance and assists in comparing models. however, limitations exist, especially with imbalanced datasets and the need for selecting a proper decision threshold.

we got to know about a tool ('neural network playground') , where we can vary the parameters and visualize the classification and regression with neural networks.

we also discussed converting regression problems into classification tasks by discretizing the continuous target variable. this method simplifies the problem by grouping continuous values into categories but involves trade-offs, including loss of detail. domain knowledge is essential for choosing proper bin thresholds.

then shifted focus to clustering methods. k-means clustering organizes data into groups based on similarity by assigning points to centroids and iteratively updating these centroids. hierarchical clustering, in contrast, builds a dendrogramâ€”a tree-like diagram that shows how clusters merge over various dissimilarity levels. the vertical height in the dendrogram represents the distance at which clusters merge. in particular, complete linkage defines cluster distance by the maximum distance between any pair of points, yielding compact, well-separated clusters.

283,started with interactive session on a website to see how the model classifies different data types. then we went for the python code for logistic regression. accuracy as a score is not that correct.  dealt with concepts of tpr fpr using the roc curve as to when false positives started to come. we plotter two distribution and interpretated situation when they starter to overlap. these actually depends on 2 factors: distribution of observations and efficiency of classifier algorithm. area under auc in a roc curve. thebetter the model means auc close to 1 worst case af 45 degree line. support in classification report is how observations support this. started new topic of clustering it is an unsupervised learning. 2 types k means and hierarchical. dendrogram gives an idea how much clusters should we make. in k means we pre allot clusters tp data points then updates based on distance from centroid. in hierarchical each point is itself a unique cluster. now depends where we cut the distance and find number of clusters. we always take maximal inter cluster distance.,-0.018121408,-0.08115458,-0.057378326,0.04147032,0.107014105,-0.04370516,-0.006526853,0.09744349,-0.010878049,0.038551785,0.016012907,-0.023504892,-0.0071304706,0.024782952,-0.05244013,-0.08350221,0.05623091,-0.11796404,-0.032278415,-0.026048696,0.011392895,-0.009931321,0.04137713,0.11066662,-0.018774157,-0.008292685,0.017938744,0.0089563625,-0.02748416,-0.015120094,-0.036136407,0.04078331,0.09391451,0.058216725,-0.043960646,0.00010110222,0.021801308,0.07455133,-0.046858206,-0.022210848,-0.011757334,-0.040054504,0.027187956,-0.03100934,0.017341321,0.026897028,-0.087303475,0.049844153,-0.08647789,0.013387359,-0.015204093,0.05836897,-0.029389476,0.05625958,-0.094427936,0.043080814,0.02903279,-0.05572001,0.046249036,-0.057424925,0.012518993,-0.043846175,-0.008338639,-0.014135444,0.06640699,0.014914409,-0.01729885,0.0680041,0.109891556,-0.018230299,0.008492477,0.043424964,0.0058672787,0.06479678,0.036300052,0.022210203,0.0517517,-0.010287838,-0.0034816405,-0.013856176,0.027695568,0.08096116,0.015330883,0.013922126,0.10608587,-0.08010473,0.028820701,-0.015210806,-0.0024150051,-0.025450153,0.035186075,0.05067673,-0.0532918,-0.048182815,-0.06622672,-0.023881467,-0.011799586,-0.055527467,0.055019036,0.046636276,-0.046542574,0.057354923,0.01880709,-0.06258665,0.03801234,-0.02452027,-0.0034854028,0.006194557,0.11115795,0.065305375,-0.007542701,0.03426095,-0.13893263,-0.00721128,0.0107293585,0.053677775,0.07973245,0.03982026,-0.04808151,0.010387931,0.012042745,-0.02948714,0.009695776,0.040645495,0.13042688,-0.06293575,-0.13010187,7.046851e-33,-0.046501677,-0.052718855,-0.016556932,-0.0049057305,0.008568621,-0.0186871,-0.112782374,0.007125993,0.07223485,0.0039051473,-0.011912585,0.07328766,0.09555053,0.049061008,0.089608505,-0.020130096,0.030178366,0.055071626,-0.07487206,-0.048354004,0.016675279,-0.020789249,0.04928073,-0.045062564,-0.028896216,0.063855514,-0.04110926,-0.013696517,0.02656426,0.037124503,-0.04428682,-0.03572752,-0.031609856,0.008580258,0.06747048,0.046898354,-0.04816672,-0.06996311,0.019356713,-0.037377007,-0.065393195,-0.009419632,0.07718177,-0.09918273,0.056803856,0.01928196,-0.011280496,-0.009682415,-0.009354941,-0.008486818,0.0054252055,-0.12993021,0.0326658,0.04242343,-0.028070163,0.087642536,-0.020877155,-0.07172542,0.0049627726,0.034809995,0.04487965,-0.09942965,-0.043949705,-0.05502196,-0.049017575,-0.021864807,0.025803939,0.07609846,0.06312049,0.03358431,-0.039536286,0.056976777,-0.020050965,0.040502384,-0.03912209,0.061680242,0.049344577,0.06522701,-0.041776557,0.02687098,-0.06436994,-0.07484647,-0.048790276,-0.04425931,0.0013781562,0.009711793,0.048299417,0.03256225,-0.09172789,-0.04680498,-0.032071292,0.030911399,0.023782242,0.029960766,-0.011385806,-8.075901e-33,-0.054194037,-0.0021297745,-0.015494561,0.011774717,-0.06930569,0.02377027,-0.06963456,0.058122557,-0.01631453,-0.07500381,-0.014184718,-0.017334945,0.060548097,-0.0027684844,-0.019836709,0.008961421,-0.0018189799,0.073486395,0.019623464,0.0075543323,0.044916496,-0.008891544,-0.029104164,-0.06734047,-0.034398053,0.045787543,-0.06606805,0.010877765,-0.08978932,0.058441635,-0.029281974,0.042278025,-0.056450702,-0.01477116,-0.009494748,0.014299645,-0.08188868,-0.06166146,0.015219967,0.032259278,0.035992637,0.05025986,-0.08400191,-0.082821876,-0.039856076,-0.03769402,0.057350814,0.06684262,0.030218823,-0.01149271,0.005396149,-0.020312587,0.03224092,0.029788963,-0.07442942,0.032969303,-0.007357337,0.006079447,-0.13126883,0.0049022585,3.0084191e-05,-0.0151438685,-0.036378693,0.068246804,-0.06401246,-0.14356154,0.021765769,0.016740499,-0.021012945,0.03675307,-0.0426348,0.044624895,0.006499522,-0.014825123,-0.042540543,0.009618063,0.050257966,-0.0034153878,-0.015462119,-0.02927696,-0.07169333,-0.018142411,-0.032201465,0.07636705,-0.010482951,0.07337606,0.06051671,0.031729203,0.07249641,0.0058351657,-0.017358577,0.058739047,-0.009211223,0.030520586,-0.035593726,-5.8709585e-08,-0.022222087,0.007185131,0.0020292639,-0.015811736,0.061387908,0.06194439,-0.08227633,0.09075392,-0.13268866,0.015857691,0.015483542,-0.002670587,-0.14214133,-0.044087566,-0.0038066711,0.023742445,0.05062021,0.08288987,-0.07692534,0.0053531975,-0.009403931,-0.0724844,0.011053858,0.030970935,-0.011647668,-0.05253989,0.024241434,0.017299352,-0.074687935,-0.04388772,-0.03749848,-0.013002635,-0.027457826,0.06279433,0.0604428,0.13411193,-0.023772124,-0.006824952,-0.10766886,0.06805757,0.02978048,0.07367397,-0.03060363,-0.0031953899,0.0224115,0.07623076,0.034599863,0.010634299,-0.021485493,0.026155535,-0.047018647,0.07897346,-0.07290032,0.016653001,0.019739209,0.06465746,-0.079631604,-0.09577186,0.029945081,0.041354693,0.076273665,-0.048000656,-0.034698308,-0.0035980025,7,10.982999,-29.879269,4
305,"we started our discussion with the classification evaluation metrics. then, we visited a website to visualize different data distributions and their classification boundaries by adjusting nodes and features for a neural network. after that, we moved to the notebook for logistic regression, where we loaded the data and converted it into a dataframe. we analyzed the classification performance using different evaluation metrics, as accuracy alone is not sufficient to validate our model's performance. we also looked at other evaluation metrics such as the confusion matrix, f1 score, recall, and accuracy. 
next, we examined the roc curve, which shows how many false positives our classifier detects before identifying true positives. the area under the roc curve (auc-roc) indicates the quality of our classifier. if the auc-roc value is less than or equal to 0.5, the classifier performs no better than a random guess.
this was for binary classification. we then moved on to multiclass classifiers, where we examined the classification evaluation scores and the confusion matrix for each class. we also looked at the auc-roc curve for each class and compared the performance of our classifier across different classes.
we started discussing clustering methods, which are unsupervised machine learning techniques. first, we explored the hierarchical clustering method. we plotted a dendrogram to analyze the closeness of data points and determine how to divide them into clusters. then, we moved on to the k-means clustering method, where we discussed how k-means assigns data points to clusters.",0.0132177435,-0.10234841,-0.105687514,0.0011547327,0.11936347,-0.021444,-0.012672156,0.03826959,0.010581666,-0.009547465,-0.05272288,-0.07103946,-0.0017521703,0.055692833,-0.10146641,-0.09627058,0.053691186,0.014594597,-0.07964102,0.047123596,0.03129844,0.03557234,0.06411955,0.054047108,-0.009068264,-0.04156089,-0.017892528,-0.029152941,-0.07590127,-0.035744235,-0.010548696,-0.006797319,0.014104983,0.037991878,-0.06731576,0.027090006,0.025556875,0.041237086,-0.023707658,-0.020325268,-0.041729793,-0.059061166,0.031790815,0.053537726,0.084942035,0.03710919,-0.06483415,-0.0037051714,-0.012298668,-0.010319606,-0.003963508,0.049946368,-0.053243283,-0.0037853871,-0.136305,0.07823529,0.056117818,-0.028646164,0.0350793,-0.0301575,0.0026102585,-0.059303466,0.018644862,0.021870086,0.008813913,0.027586846,-0.04419577,-0.020261316,0.049866054,0.052012194,0.04638805,0.04119293,-0.006444995,0.06861891,0.0038183415,0.055025052,0.06720719,0.060566,-0.01121649,0.018901844,0.013737469,0.042757727,0.0119544845,0.02165956,0.14331667,-0.037934843,0.020480148,-0.050457373,-0.039889153,0.042426683,0.023071816,0.0351882,0.023772305,-0.061288532,-0.027415564,-0.0045850184,-0.018978084,-0.04901896,0.023309989,0.036479887,-0.0556843,0.048209224,-0.028687015,-0.106344715,0.06592425,0.018180069,0.009222171,0.027324963,0.095232464,0.035113744,0.022766922,0.08665607,-0.15545252,0.019681616,0.029202808,0.05384615,0.024445005,0.043460622,-0.017928183,0.14701693,-0.06778388,-0.025721323,0.079185136,0.0031448125,0.055931866,-0.03403482,-0.11977215,2.2960305e-33,-0.07031365,-0.0069006863,0.0031048963,-0.041788843,-0.0052813925,-0.0421274,-0.087433785,0.017936302,0.0166647,-0.00022826511,-0.045155935,0.13674535,0.042636994,0.08488519,0.107189454,0.0686356,-0.04544675,0.005460015,-0.060780905,-0.03425337,0.05209468,-0.04333919,0.059208415,0.004765695,-0.0037727428,0.019422736,-0.028049568,0.04563336,-0.038782828,0.01729195,-0.07475464,-0.046496935,0.07400894,-0.0072623063,0.048120674,0.030248065,-0.0046089473,0.006083078,-0.014803634,0.00046244578,-0.1053244,-0.045084894,-0.0003422446,-0.042406388,0.0036667027,0.018072607,-0.00024189922,-0.025264973,-0.032642204,-0.034162756,0.018477995,-0.07671355,0.043497168,0.0591352,-0.052030925,0.05465459,0.028715236,-0.0014692589,-0.02266088,0.022101736,-0.011793171,-0.020226765,-0.07552894,-0.04780977,-0.096866064,-0.034673803,0.016510865,0.08458413,0.029362192,-0.022951532,-0.05225459,0.015943404,-0.006319117,-0.007936718,0.025652284,0.028024798,0.022367083,0.0163864,-0.015606181,0.0015763968,-0.0026599988,-0.014707714,-0.019360673,-0.063607775,-0.029241767,0.04810349,0.03220744,0.022682965,-0.07237094,0.044151913,-0.027903263,0.033443112,0.013968739,0.0019650464,-0.06912378,-2.9574606e-33,-0.0811828,-0.00056326523,-0.011727044,0.12136233,-0.02257438,0.018692313,-0.023432627,0.035732105,-0.063805625,-0.0688662,0.019669782,0.001278209,0.03181724,0.061765853,-0.0392246,0.026304424,-0.04710071,0.03235245,0.017976478,0.008337537,0.065890625,0.10595653,-0.05677901,-0.06914546,-0.07284833,0.07094574,-0.058355477,0.012846205,-0.032142717,-0.015297405,0.007094125,0.03451033,-0.003817755,0.019543184,0.08928228,0.011901957,-6.96015e-05,-0.077454634,0.013698799,0.12205661,-0.03159082,0.09096015,-0.09995098,-0.020203182,-0.03605466,-0.024893701,0.021236405,0.11060302,0.01298919,0.0020138843,-0.017466,-0.02079674,-0.012825106,0.09575724,-0.011761197,0.0031892203,-0.039379317,-0.043233033,-0.0791306,0.07872621,-0.061586518,0.045442507,-0.029664116,0.042844113,-0.030346015,-0.08645442,0.04057883,0.023805507,-0.027986743,0.03042637,-0.046829317,0.023347532,-0.020747105,-0.03649288,-0.052032053,0.03573612,0.04387508,0.035375427,-0.050588798,-0.03876772,-0.032038607,-0.020699576,-0.00855148,0.034224242,-0.014213883,0.048664186,0.09545903,0.03900932,0.05426488,0.018945646,-0.022919994,0.060676176,-0.049581576,0.030502304,-0.02421991,-5.3924417e-08,-0.0072651403,0.03304698,0.03731397,-0.050702643,-0.031147432,0.040082105,-0.08007566,0.11890376,-0.08891823,-0.013368995,0.07556238,-0.012970854,-0.17920862,-0.04013738,0.02544628,0.016586494,0.026411137,0.08420149,-0.004381714,0.036775637,0.009832184,-0.03420899,0.00040187925,-0.017133655,0.001637072,-0.08396939,0.0004465915,0.049265333,-0.06436821,-0.025729926,-0.054945722,0.011136012,-0.018272953,0.017703746,0.010671569,0.10300663,-0.0042303586,-0.0034753487,-0.019412598,0.1276437,0.024434796,0.072573505,-0.06744425,0.025222937,-0.025510043,-0.026674643,0.0064831018,0.05368149,0.002735118,-0.023065982,-0.037558217,-0.0039017221,-0.08747108,0.04695563,0.023852536,0.01798654,-0.09836827,-0.10698236,-0.0038435454,0.107945696,0.033402678,-0.057164926,-0.03103391,-0.017934902,7,8.145127,-30.603647,4
322,"roc curves, which depict true positives against false positives at different threshold values, were the subject of our exploration today. we discovered that the classifier's performance decreased with a flatter curve. while the false positive rate continues to rise, a flat curve suggests that the classifier is making a large number of inaccurate predictions and that raising the threshold has no discernible effect on the true positive rate. the low auc (area under the curve) score in these situations further supports subpar performance. since the diagonal line (y = x) reflects random guessing, a successful classifier should ideally have an auc well above 0.5. the graph's area above this line shows improved categorization

349,"today's lecture covered the quality of classifiers, emphasizing that accuracy alone is not a reliable metric. instead, we should analyze precision, recall, and the roc curve to assess performance. precision (tp / (tp + fp)) and recall (tp / (tp + fn)) help measure how well a model predicts positive cases while minimizing false negatives.

we also discussed clustering, an unsupervised learning method where data is grouped without predefined labels. k-means clustering requires specifying the number of clusters, while hierarchical clustering determines clusters automatically based on data structure.

the confusion matrix was introduced to evaluate models using true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. accuracy is calculated as (tp + tn) / total samples. we also explored logistic regression and neural networks, highlighting their role in classification.

finally, the roc curve and auc were discussed. a higher auc (closer to 1) indicates a better classifier, while 0.5 suggests random performance. a poor classifier flattens the roc curve, reducing its ability to distinguish between classes. overall, the lecture focused on evaluating classifiers and clustering techniques effectively.",-0.009954619,-0.060483478,-0.044930037,0.029003616,0.058557436,0.0014119936,0.032281186,0.039889153,-0.007975378,-0.048987817,0.011523168,-0.08381863,0.05016671,0.03982408,-0.11046634,-0.08784179,0.06524544,0.04468958,-0.002012548,-0.015204991,0.035705294,0.03630601,0.06813448,0.06973401,-0.042652786,-0.0076026684,0.004882626,-0.016099894,-0.061824244,-0.025694577,-0.036494426,0.022573719,0.019116571,0.03502082,-0.056571145,0.021105304,0.020095907,0.079360664,-0.01851961,-0.007991711,-0.051003646,-0.039246947,-0.008822867,0.018839592,0.05317457,0.052374955,-0.080181755,0.023473453,-0.04600855,0.022908289,-0.011286694,0.05577637,-0.061283927,0.0016158762,-0.08356035,0.08961669,0.036697894,0.003968596,-0.01010177,-0.0056662825,0.02266932,-0.08183704,0.017954541,-0.0084589105,0.011625608,0.033672575,-0.034666203,0.00922395,0.026549226,-0.018863752,0.012343693,0.06433461,0.012871939,0.082741305,-0.044901796,0.08017651,0.07639742,0.09029311,0.04147181,0.046963017,0.021892799,0.03592061,-0.079065114,0.015364828,0.17109492,-0.033664893,0.027638575,-0.0032042114,-0.03429357,0.0186635,0.013395099,0.026886888,0.046120573,-0.08710608,-0.03627171,-0.014299873,-0.023136271,-0.06535313,0.0050151967,0.05519309,-0.07465207,0.07094735,-0.008641896,-0.12762518,0.00036141585,-0.021654429,-0.022602754,0.016570529,0.1574427,0.027097253,-0.01925003,0.035475757,-0.14459704,-0.016301163,0.056122083,0.06615623,0.07964105,0.041885763,-0.0019072448,0.105071634,-0.04846131,-0.03807592,0.072911456,0.05228714,0.07439414,-0.05057238,-0.11373115,4.5572292e-33,-0.04757751,-0.021114485,0.040660046,0.0032872614,-0.0060936892,-0.05296213,-0.11930775,0.015848296,0.035612963,0.021335427,0.019231064,0.042594444,0.029937232,0.06501282,0.073329456,0.048620995,-0.0403709,0.01441134,-0.07697753,-0.109686166,0.012909008,-0.011020991,0.104437284,-0.06862303,-0.023094846,0.028494613,-0.022374572,0.025160585,0.020402554,0.0077296193,-0.038368996,-0.067290485,0.05800125,-0.010949283,0.05271204,0.033730496,-0.024360562,-0.032391842,0.013427652,-0.021146674,-0.0710679,-0.0009632037,0.047123186,-0.0831911,0.02728629,0.0053739804,0.037236005,-0.061803203,0.006784108,0.0033589678,0.0075591137,-0.10393299,-0.018010497,0.064848185,-0.06840552,0.04802855,0.008778452,0.03682484,-0.014687302,0.025105149,-0.0034612804,-0.033460137,-0.057132915,-0.024529183,-0.102326386,-0.025476405,0.023860695,0.12786652,0.035377912,-0.01791967,-0.017829472,0.033298656,-0.0068260315,0.022114873,-0.0312088,0.04988825,0.06385802,0.014907693,-0.033516623,0.019214429,0.0102621205,-0.04736083,-0.05646788,-0.03792978,-0.05681965,0.007186968,0.055815097,0.020560142,-0.05891465,0.06646612,-0.09325923,0.022136828,0.027980179,0.03450805,-0.058064874,-5.5009227e-33,-0.06552821,-0.010182481,-0.04190741,0.06742548,-0.044136737,0.0059086313,0.0076938495,0.070162356,-0.036171574,-0.056036793,0.0049207746,-0.013625947,0.031132089,0.015394074,-0.010994584,0.028426154,-0.04148037,0.058912404,0.02553589,0.024834586,0.018496124,0.034854706,-0.0342162,-0.031117769,-0.044640884,0.09955928,-0.059109114,0.026073582,-0.035531793,-0.005139566,0.0023809108,0.045679472,-0.015515025,0.040659185,0.027795454,0.0027320771,0.0017328615,-0.079144,0.030529251,0.06893022,-0.0031953491,0.099874236,-0.09949387,-0.026012637,-0.04941315,-0.08389009,0.03724379,0.034704175,0.0005853908,-0.0060214815,-0.04953147,-0.016149897,-0.054266542,0.06303667,-0.006442042,0.030035479,-0.062928945,-0.029532768,-0.06310228,0.07457306,-0.08480073,0.013345903,-0.035442144,0.0014154884,-0.048899572,-0.10483424,0.029101983,0.048571005,-0.026463581,0.03413145,-0.009658332,0.088518366,-0.0024739825,-0.057931706,-0.07122202,-0.059629876,0.024511568,0.0256925,-0.015614446,-0.07374676,-0.007873869,-0.04656189,-0.052134395,0.07783378,0.00062394084,0.026997764,0.081671864,0.041444432,0.040679645,0.024895854,-0.03262979,0.084377185,0.022167109,0.025433678,-0.05488362,-4.893936e-08,-0.012762522,-0.00021154185,0.03306109,-0.012247277,-0.011841943,-0.018562045,-0.07353881,0.11045219,-0.10224123,-0.021169443,0.05635478,-0.015071583,-0.1665588,-0.06048935,0.0025785281,-0.017223785,0.017960971,0.11795261,0.01199936,0.0022740196,0.03707637,-0.058102384,0.03224987,0.030651221,0.021790635,-0.09296596,0.017308032,0.08850386,-0.01986724,-0.040880702,-0.037838217,-0.015786983,0.01856837,0.032700505,0.01893754,0.13672878,-0.037173133,0.01069575,-0.060893167,0.07176146,-0.012728069,0.08457044,-0.06938149,0.0062386426,-0.02660768,0.004412225,0.02678555,-0.0039503765,-0.0022183121,-0.035803534,-0.022766566,0.05637404,-0.081674844,0.04555999,-0.0033678638,0.050204094,-0.08267592,-0.09039253,-0.0093271565,0.025510216,0.042462494,-0.02931034,-0.059438728,0.00682457,7,8.529663,-29.696884,4
365,"we first revised a few concepts from the previous class. to assess the quality of any classification model, we use the confusion matrix. the confusion matrix gives us the number of points that are correctly identified and those that are incorrectly identified, in a tabulated manner. sir showed us some code for fitting a given data set with a logistic regression model and obtaining the various metrics associated with it. the â€˜scoreâ€™ represents the accuracy in a classification model, just like it represents r in regression. we also found out the true positive rate and the false positive rate. these are key metrics used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. true positive rate measures the fraction of the actual positives that are correctly determined by the model. similarly, false positives represent the proportion of actual negatives that are incorrectly classified as positive.
the receiver operating curve (roc) plots tpr vs fpr. if the curve is nearly vertical, then it means before classifying any points as â€˜false positivesâ€™, all the â€˜true positivesâ€™ have already been identified. on the other hand, if the line is exactly 45 degrees, it means the classification is completely random, or we can say that we are not using any classifier at all. so ideally, we want our plot to be as steep as possible. also, the area under the curve for a good classifier should be as close to 1 as possible. various points along the curve represent different threshold values. as you increase the threshold, the model becomes more stricter and hence, there are lesser chances of obtaining true positives, thereby increasing the false negatives. 
a good classifier is fine until there arenâ€™t any significant overlaps in the data sets. however, if the two sets have significantly high overlap, then no classifier will work well for it.
so, we can improve the quality of our classifier by either transforming the data or creating new and relevant features using feature engineering.
we also looked at yet another metric- â€˜supportâ€™. this represents the total number of observations that are in â€˜supportâ€™ of the class, i.e. the number of observations, that have been classified under that class by the model.
next, we started with â€˜clusteringâ€™. this is another unsupervised learning algorithm. in this, the points in a given data set are clustered and different groups are made among these. this is usually a part of eda and is used to assign labels to unlabeled data. there are two types of models in it- k means clustering and hierarchical clustering. 
in k- means clustering, we have to specify the number of â€˜meansâ€™ or in other words the number of clusters that we want. this is not the case for hierarchical clustering. 
in k- means clustering, all the points are randomly classified first and based on these, a mean value is obtained. using this mean value, the distance between a point and the means of various clusters is calculated and this is done for every point. the point is reassigned to a cluster, whose mean value is closest to the point. the new mean for a cluster is re- calculated based on the new points. then again, the points are reassigned into different clusters. this is repeatedly done, until we reach a step wherein there is no change in the arrangement of the points. this is our final clustering. 
if the initial assignment of the points to various clusters differs, we can get different clusters every time for the same data set. so, we run multiple such algorithms and the final cluster for a point is chosen to be that cluster in which it falls for the maximum number of times. 
hierarchical clustering algorithm considers every point as a cluster in itself, and starts clubbing all the clusters one by one, until it reaches a final single cluster with all the points. this is represented as a dendrogram. the height of the leg of the diagram represents the distance between the two points/clusters. so, hierarchical clustering gives many different clusters, which are combined and recombined to form larger and larger clusters. we can decide upto which point we want the clusters. thatâ€™s it for this class.

407,"today we saw how a neural network shows decision boundaries for datasets with the aid of playground.tensorflow.org. and i was able to take key performance metrics such as precision, accuracy, recall, and f1-score under consideration. true positive and false positive rates were elaborated on. where the true positive rate (sense) is derived from the formula tp/(tp + fn) and that of the false positive trend is fp/(fp + tn). in turn, accuracy basically evaluates the proportion between true-positive and true-negative cases against the total number of predictions made. on top of that, i computed a classifier using positive and negative distributions tagged differently that accounted for the likelihood of misclassification within the regions where those two distributions overlap. the evaluation of classifier effectiveness using the roc curve: the steeper the curve, the better the classifier; a 45-degree line indicates random guessing. the area under the curve-auc-was also mentioned: that the closer to 1 the auc is, the better the classifier, while an auc of 0.5 indicates no meaningful discrimination against the class. the precision rate was defined as the ratio between correctly classified instances of a class and the total instances predicted as that class, while the recall gives the ratio between correctly classified instances of a class and the total actual instances of that class. besides, going to be opened concerning unsupervised learning, where labeled data are not required; hence, the function y = f(x)- where y need not be presented. in this area, there are clustering methods such as k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, cluster items without any label, and any without any target labels.

414,"we explored playground tensorflow and worked on classifying two spirals. then, we studied logistic regression, focusing on accuracy, precision, recall, true positives, and true negatives. we learned about the roc curve, which helps analyze when a classifier starts detecting false positives. a good classifier has an inverted l-shaped roc curve with an auc close to 1, while a poor classifier has a flatter curve. we also realized that if data is too overlapping, it becomes difficult to develop a reliable classifier. when working with imbalanced data, we observed that the underrepresented class had a very low f1 score, highlighting the challenges in fraud detection where data imbalance is common. additionally, we explored unsupervised learning techniques like k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering, where dendrograms provide insights into how observations are

440,"we started of by looking at the website tensorflow playground and then changed various parameters of the neural network and had a look at the prediction, and errors which the neural network model makes in determining a given dataset with different kinds of distribution. we then looked at the metrics involved in the classifier mechanism (like the auc metric: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve which is plotted vs false positive rate) and how classifier becomes more complex than regression mechanisms. we can seperate the data by transformations and feature

442,"we studied different types of roc curves today, which depict the relationship between true positives and false positives at various thresholds. the classifierâ€™s performance deteriorated the more the curve is flat. a flat roc curve indicates that the model is consistently mispredicting at higher rate because there is no effect on the true positive when the threshold is increased but the false positive keeps increasing. in these settings, the low auc value offers additional justification for the classifier failure. any part of the curve that customarily exceeds the diagonal x=y line represents a better model because it had a value of auc of 0.5.

447,"we first started by exploring playground.tensorflow.org then we continued our discussion on confusion matrix (false positive, true negative etc). when does classifier start detecting incorrect false positives? all true positive detected before detecting false positive. distribution of observations or classifier is sharp to distinguish between classes (ability is seen in receiver operating characteristic curve ie roc curve - if probability >0.5 then 1, else 0). area under the curve (auc) = 1 is best classifier, worst is 0.5 (y=x line). then we discussed data imbalance (fraudulent transaction). do not judge classifier by accuracy; judge by confusion matrix ie precision, recall, etc. clustering is unsupervised learning. we discussed k means clustering (means is a representation of points) - algorithm assigns data points randomly to clusters, derives centroids, finds distances of points from centroids, re-assigns. we saw dendrogram (hierarchial clustering/ bottom up - tree like) - we will use complete linkage.

450,"the session started with a review of gradient descent before introducing logistic regression. the professor explained the confusion matrix and showed a website for experimenting with neural network clustering.
we then explored logistic regression code and learned about key performance metrics like precision, recall, and the f1 score. the roc curve was introduced, with the false positive rate on the x-axis and the true positive rate on the y-axis, showing different curves for each class.
later, the topic shifted to clustering. it began with hierarchical clustering, followed by k-means clustering, where the number of clusters is set in advance. this helped students understand different ways to group data.

455,"first sir showed us the website play around which allows us to visualise neural networks changing the number of layers, epochs, etc. further sir showed us a piece of code in a jupyter notebook and demonstrated models fitting, confusion matrix, true positive rate and false positive rate. then we studied receiver operating characteristic curve were an area under the curve closer to 1 indicates a good classification model and vise versa. then we saw a model which classified 4 classes where one of the classes was under represented. here class imbalance affected the model and it was not interpreted in the accuracy but was found out by confusion matrix and precision, recall parameters. then it was discussed how a regression problem could be converted into a classification problem but not the vise versa due to information loss. then sir taught clustering which is an unsupervised learning method. here the model has to identify the clusters and assign labels. to identify the clusters dendrogram is plotted to find the clusters. further k means clustering was discussed where desired number of clusters are to be specified beforehand via domain knowledge and every point in data is assigned to one of these clusters. the model here initially assigns random labels and later converges to clusters on the basis of distance from the means. later cluster means are recalculated and reassignment of labels is done until the model converges. other algorithm for clustering is hierarchical clustering where every point is a unique cluster clusters are formed by defining a 'linkage' upon which further clustering is done and clusters are merged and a dendrogram is formed to show the steps and appropriate number of clusters could be formed from the dendrogram.",-0.04151958,-0.062994234,-0.027899068,0.041645125,0.03203757,0.02275037,-0.009454374,0.039562773,0.035935502,-0.02165903,-0.016653778,-0.009265752,0.088487476,-0.021385765,-0.08283959,-0.08405036,0.029521672,0.043971743,-0.054621354,-0.045907132,0.07714421,0.032035436,-0.0047133784,0.0790363,-0.030669492,-0.026895,0.009584737,0.005179683,-0.041653086,-0.085979715,0.024495894,0.06668808,-0.029477607,0.08823184,-0.06683014,0.07359753,0.0041603185,0.085982405,-0.017070012,-0.00012331987,-0.018418267,-0.026736476,-0.04646101,0.022631012,0.098491296,0.003855436,-0.08020369,-0.008269835,-0.0796901,-0.0033686722,-0.06615263,0.00873255,-0.021097861,0.008655695,-0.09500683,0.0031458181,0.060303684,0.041750897,-0.0547033,0.046068963,0.039633956,-0.106829524,-0.018670117,-0.035867598,0.03121492,0.034878716,-0.03577002,0.01781185,0.06212669,-0.02857577,0.02474705,0.050334375,-0.023840364,0.01084374,0.015810369,0.01777826,0.0784426,0.093446456,0.039589986,0.019772971,0.0067639668,0.05796102,-0.038309053,0.008447559,0.08606309,-0.019005004,-0.043950606,0.006257355,-0.019048842,-0.052190967,-0.049484044,-0.000583028,-0.014528786,-0.03185374,0.02606783,0.038575787,0.03950694,-0.0468679,0.05669565,0.08889303,-0.020441646,0.08149786,0.0141395945,-0.03441924,0.0029439414,-0.025842996,0.038694322,0.018548368,0.1294516,-0.037921555,-0.023702743,0.0015685507,-0.1318511,-0.037289813,0.012747309,0.012010486,0.08558107,0.011517817,-0.120814085,0.08621375,-0.061309718,-0.009404754,-0.034545265,0.022328816,0.08170581,0.0025901508,-0.18250756,7.1373225e-33,-0.0517842,-0.06982089,0.01061002,0.00025582672,0.047769908,-0.0601017,-0.08687416,0.016575487,0.11964362,-0.049439605,-0.004910415,0.025309691,0.04868771,0.10057403,0.040953618,-0.021182857,-0.04800791,0.054419454,0.0017453594,-0.12177192,-0.041668456,-0.022097696,0.047091074,-0.068066776,-0.066216424,0.05399155,-0.015906861,0.0073841354,0.038573556,0.012439709,-0.029623223,-0.0043756557,-0.0019095435,-0.052209362,0.034724023,0.029894123,0.0067851376,-0.01640576,0.0487632,-0.026899477,-0.059850678,0.008734944,0.03994013,-0.02238459,0.017842053,-0.0035614015,0.07529025,-0.07926123,-0.027402071,-0.035953805,-0.03177922,-0.08963379,-0.021698125,0.0039452505,0.011316447,0.100759864,0.035202276,-0.017694678,-0.0044605653,0.06916498,0.045129765,-0.02627716,0.008497083,0.028135626,-0.034931157,-0.042275917,0.01986627,0.07814215,0.028726004,0.05779467,-0.054780062,0.05446343,-0.07564793,0.041776087,0.012253418,0.021963388,0.017131496,0.042870037,-0.04024283,0.00808488,0.025990427,-0.040227253,-0.069544874,-0.05899519,-0.08160635,0.033203486,0.11450585,-0.056660928,0.002536776,0.042843223,-0.044516668,0.006925987,0.038693067,0.011265442,-0.026972873,-8.62527e-33,-0.09671166,0.070297405,-0.10720733,0.06680392,-0.022221323,0.018032277,-0.013968837,0.11839048,-0.068321325,-0.03558459,-0.015278117,0.01222259,-0.0167329,0.043892454,-0.038418308,0.028109252,0.007981616,0.010227505,0.031098353,0.025534758,-0.01437442,0.069092505,-0.05746773,-0.058528278,-0.061193086,0.054076806,-0.095169745,0.07808571,-0.00472581,0.008771786,-0.0046469728,-0.011489528,-0.053364776,0.05253812,0.0072285263,0.03185222,0.007185097,-0.084396005,0.0052642752,0.024375863,0.019304905,0.050336167,-0.11024241,-0.0002824606,-0.011139499,-0.089472644,0.030101262,0.06952663,0.00289377,0.008536914,-0.0009961718,-0.019884305,-0.038230836,0.035901915,-0.04167411,0.05448898,-0.027589275,0.0021317482,-0.044175588,0.106974415,-0.057026424,-0.060048357,-0.07648253,-0.051962536,-0.037057538,-0.08088156,0.011680399,0.054485757,0.007877257,0.05881828,0.040605497,0.028559368,0.023046058,-0.037989832,-0.015353424,-0.053607695,-0.05498359,0.051920928,-0.09676844,-0.040366694,-0.038544815,-0.027753178,-0.003094486,0.05470541,0.014863941,0.044961795,0.08006737,0.027549181,0.04182849,-0.040202525,-0.0396519,0.041255545,0.006060186,0.07903669,-0.052562382,-6.886044e-08,-0.029547697,0.0134748,0.05693196,-0.037821162,0.021487111,-0.07765668,-0.06386484,0.10135209,-0.08868746,0.060287118,0.03111279,-0.019488301,-0.109832115,0.013520643,-0.009680906,0.07199805,0.04626274,0.08892961,-0.010602106,-0.006820745,0.03842453,-0.08562985,0.0145004215,0.037455037,0.07798896,-0.12656191,-0.0030062199,0.1005701,-0.056720316,-0.0049985657,-0.056809682,0.008589017,0.019995134,0.006064572,0.021285215,0.058445122,0.013148853,-0.0325328,0.0047913985,0.043633055,-0.031551857,0.02404436,-0.04871695,0.039456386,0.052817408,0.04246253,0.05442535,-0.06067955,0.020695545,-0.043970685,-0.045618616,0.0549503,-0.020398403,0.061410315,0.03656795,-0.03737838,-0.07404541,-0.08532111,0.013553488,0.057517506,0.026470987,0.04789998,-0.046377726,-0.046396527,7,9.652818,-27.947327,4
461,today we looked at different types of roc curves.roc curve plots true positive vs false positive at various threshold values.we deduced that flatter the curve is worse is the classifier because a flat curve tells that increasing the threshold does not improve the true positive much but the false positive continues to increase which suggests that the classifier is making a lot of incorrect predictions.in this case the auc value is low which also shows poor performance of classifiers. normally y=x line has aoc value of 0.5 so the portion of the graph that is above the line y=x gives

475,"we looked at several types of receiver operating characteristic curves. a roc curve visually depicts the performance of a binary classification model across all possible classification thresholds, plotting the true positive rate (sensitivity) on the y-axis against the false positive rate (1 - specificity) on the x-axis, essentially showing how well a model can distinguish between positive and negative classes at different cut-off points; a higher area under the curve (auc) indicates better overall classification performance. this occurs as a result of false positives continuing to rise, suggesting a high frequency of inaccurate forecasts, but genuine positives are not considerably increased by raising the threshold. in these situations, a low auc value validates poor classifier performance. better performance is shown by any portion of the graph above the x=y line, which typically correlates to an auc of

476,"logistic regression, classification, and clustering took center stage in todayâ€™s session. the discussion kicked off with error metrics and the confusion matrix, highlighting their significance in evaluating model performance. tensorflow playground provided an interactive way to explore classification problems visually, reinforcing key concepts.

diving into the coding aspect, we implemented logistic regression while emphasizing why metrics like the confusion matrix and roc curves offer deeper insights than simple accuracy scores. the roc curve emerged as a crucial tool for assessing classifiers, with an auc value close to 1 indicating strong performance. we also explored how adjusting classification thresholds impacts the roc curve and tackled the complexities of multi-class classification, particularly when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

shifting gears to unsupervised learning, the focus moved to clustering techniques. k-means, with its requirement to predefine the number of clusters, was explored alongside its iterative approach to grouping data points. in contrast, hierarchical clustering provided a more flexible alternative, generating a dendrogram to reveal cluster relationships and guide decisions on the optimal number of

515,"in todayâ€™s class we continued our discussion on data sets. we seen plot of data set . there were cases when there was clear clusters of different types of points . there was case where there was no clear seperation of clusters. we then saw roc. roc (receiver operating characteristic) curve is a graphical representation used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, particularly for binary classification problems. it plots the true positive  rate (tpr) against the false positive rate (fpr) at various threshold settings. also we discussed about supervised and unsupervised clustering. types of clustering : k-means and hierarchical. k-means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group data into k clusters. it works by initializing k centroids, assigning each data point to the nearest centroid, and iteratively updating centroids by computing the mean of assigned points. hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that builds a hierarchy of clusters without requiring a predefined number of clusters. the results are represented as a dendogram.

523,"we revised score, precision, recall, confusion matrix, accuracy and also saw playground website. we saw tpr and fpr and their importance. the classifier already detects true positives before detecting false positive (vertical). receiver operating characteristics: classifier discriminate between classes in a very nice way is reflected in roc curve. if probability greater than 0.5 than 1 otheriwise 0. at different number like 0.1 or 0.5 ; what will be the behaviour of classifier (value or probability) - sharpness and quality of classifier. more random curve is more random classifier. we saw definition of clustering and depth of clusters. sometimes part of eda : unsupervised learning in reality. two kinds : k means and hierarchical methods. how to decide cluster is good and matrix associated with it. assignments: pdf with size big no text.. we do eda on data. and then subject it to clustering: hierarchies and means (mean is representative of observations). randomly assign to mean to different points then reassign and repeat.( k means algo) so we discussed basically the algorithm of both clustering and visualisation.

544,"we analyzed different types of roc curves today. an roc curve charts the true positive rate against the false positive rate for classifying instances at different threshold levels. we established that a curve that is flat signifies that the classifier performs poorly. the flat curve means that even if the threshold is raised, there will be no significant increase in true positive rates, but the false positive rate will increase. it means that the classifier is overpredicting. during these instances, the auc value is low, meaning that the classifier does not perform well. in most cases, the diagonal line y=x which represents a random classifier and has an auc of 0.5 is weak, therefore, any part of the graph that is above this line represents improved model

545,"we started by learning about the tool ""playground.tensorflow"" where we visualized the dataset and how we can adjust the neural network to get it as accurate as possible. we did changes by increasing and decreasing the number of layers, as we keep increasing the degree of freedom, the ann adjust to more changes and the boundary is closer to the actual boundary until a point, after which it leads to overfitting of data. we saw graphs of false positive and false negative and them overlapping. we would like to have classifier which can distinguish between two classes even if they overlap. we see this in the roc curve (receiver operator characteristic curve), the importance and significance of the area under roc curve. we saw different roc curves and understood what shape indicates best fit. sometimes, there is lesser data for one class as compared to the others, such cases in real life are when there are fraudulent cases, and the classifier usually misses this out. we observed a code in python which can plot the roc curves and saw the output figures. clustering is unsupervised type, and we looked at the code and algorithm for it. in the end we learnt about k means clustering. and in the end we saw hierarchical clustering method.

579,"at the beginning of the class logistic regression was visualized through graph on playground.tensorflow.org. confusion matrix was discussed upon . ratios such as true positive rate and false positive rate were introduced . then we discussed plot of tpr v/s fpr which is called roc ( receiver operating characteristic) curve , which tells us about the quality of the regression. auc of roc is between 0.5 and 1 , wher area=1 depicts a good classifier and a curve with area 0.5 is not accurate as it randomly classifies observations. after that we moved on to clustering (an unsupervised

593,"in today's class, we first started with a website named playground.tensorflow.org in which we had several options of several features and different kinds of data types and we came to our conclusion that by increasing the number of features we can even use the simplest of the model to get the appropriate results that is the correct model. delhi came to know about true positive rate and false positive rate and their formulae. then we discussed the receiver operating characteristic curve which shows when does the classifier start detecting incorrect or the false positives like if the curve is steeply rising in the starting and then when it completely rows then it is turning towards the right then it is accurate rather than when it is less steeply rising or rising like a curve. if we add more features roc will get better this is called feature engineering. auc is the area under the roc curve and when auc is 5 this means that there is no classifier or there is no need of any classifier because it is something like tossing a coin. we used to do like if probability is greater than equal to 0.5 then it is class one otherwise class zero so what happens if we change this probability to 0.4 or 0.3, so for that the different points on the roc curve correspond to these various different thresholds. then using a simple data set we calculated precision and recall of different classes. we can convert a regression problem to a classification problem like if we have heights we can create bins like 2 - 4 feet ,  4 - 6 feet like that. but classification to regression is not possible because data loss happens in such a case. when we started with the clustering which is a kind of unsupervised learning which means that we dont have y value we only have x value. we then learned about king's clustering in which we pre decide the number of clusters and how this mechanism works. then we learned hierarchical clustering in which there is no need to specify the number of clusters and which results in

594,"first today we learned abt the playgroundtensor site. it was related to neural network but as in data science, ml models are often used for predicting outcomes based on data similarly in tensorflow allows you to explore how different neural network architectures affect the ability of model to learn data.then we learned abt the confusion matrix which provides summary of prediction of results of comparing actual vs. predicted values. it is abt false negative and true positive etc. then we saw the dendogram which is the hierarchy clustering tree. we also discussed abt data imbalance which occurs when one class in a dataset has significantly more samples than

597,"we started our lecture by visiting an interesting website playground.tensorflow.org. where we can create different types of samples and apply ann to classify the elements of this sample. we then jumped into our jupyter notebook where we learnt that we don't have to trust the logist_regr.score and instead we prefer to look at true positive rate. we then roc curve of tp rate vs fp rate. we would like it to have auc = 1. even a random classification has auc = 0.5. we then had a look at a case where a particular class is under represented. it generally happens when a particular class is representing fraudulent entries. it is a huge problem as this class usually gets misclassified. precision and recall values of this class were very low. we concluded our lecture with a brief discussion on k-means clustering where we had a look on linkages, number of nodes.

608,"we started off with a display of a site that gives us visualization of classification, named playground.tensorflow.org. after that we returned back to metrics oof logistics regression. we saw that the the given score that tells us about the accuracy can't be trusted totally. moving on we saw the receiver operating characteristics (roc) curve. the roc curve indicates the quality of the model. the sharper the better. there is another term called auc which is basically the area under the roc curve. ideally it should be near to 1 for a good classifier.
we then came to clustering. this is a part of unsupervised learning, that is it doesn't have labels. there are algorithms like k-means and other.",-2.053456e-05,-0.1099279,-0.09971158,0.07950776,0.13700229,-0.026128914,0.024848992,0.014658187,-0.014118414,-0.021942114,-0.008123701,-0.013582982,0.023266912,0.056086127,-0.121045895,-0.07642354,0.11729115,-0.049905837,-0.012414108,-0.024182394,-0.04278187,0.025641602,0.060370523,0.086686485,-0.0063602417,0.03212001,-0.03175747,-0.0036789132,-0.054008164,-0.067189954,-0.009062503,0.017872488,0.07200417,0.019807562,-0.02896129,0.05007779,0.0564031,0.025244277,-0.065186605,-0.022583736,-0.0031428186,-0.02903247,0.039938685,0.07435611,0.014808066,0.038469058,-0.06380761,-0.05085448,-0.060397405,0.017258482,-0.0075077447,-0.008123561,-0.099859476,0.043101907,-0.1058316,0.07925211,-0.01645029,-0.010111208,0.045298915,-0.0019341427,0.05560132,-0.050547864,0.008158248,0.023114689,0.06686103,0.010520029,-0.01348796,-0.020431917,0.02106683,-0.02497272,0.0628671,0.0003622446,0.045301717,0.08132988,0.043532398,0.044370703,0.040360194,-0.012619441,0.050141703,0.05561398,-0.032781474,0.051473826,-0.008474334,0.014458954,0.07120303,0.0021347508,0.035261925,-0.033622783,-0.0043816627,-0.029844107,-0.015427693,0.014445051,-0.019158034,-0.09063666,-0.02446958,-0.04836108,0.034032207,-0.036389485,0.041856818,0.040259406,-0.06229683,0.060057223,0.023223214,-0.058932845,0.050494578,0.028113361,-0.0019155748,0.0065133395,0.08846414,0.06192418,-0.027588943,0.06442892,-0.087955385,-0.007736547,-0.013513853,0.011257622,0.027361218,-0.01590929,-0.02836201,0.040238723,-0.0159617,-0.0571654,0.061121993,0.039806116,0.03910136,-0.009022057,-0.08168492,-1.5181522e-33,-0.07390889,-0.058994826,0.009674904,-0.084375344,-0.010367778,-0.05551059,-0.09365283,-0.0031608639,0.11805731,0.032242864,0.0038544694,0.14767478,0.081606485,0.09576001,0.12862007,-0.033724952,0.009165545,0.047767386,-0.047842134,-0.048336152,0.0063503594,-0.0199499,0.0369995,-0.045312785,-0.045620795,0.04366127,-0.042760927,0.057331964,0.059852645,0.032028396,0.007849593,-0.019097324,0.052392695,-0.036657624,0.030798202,0.041661996,-0.013134961,-0.027283695,0.03301047,-0.029030932,-0.034919944,-0.021570716,0.039632633,-0.06670978,0.011579669,0.02487096,0.005169583,-0.0461741,-0.04084859,-0.015341553,-0.043281995,-0.16551532,0.037857182,0.052686676,-0.039657734,0.05116279,-0.0119644925,-0.056077365,-0.071183994,0.026940873,0.04294509,-0.038175054,-0.03052514,-0.043609884,-0.06982966,-0.055171523,0.03132294,0.06908696,0.016347459,0.03758536,-0.04203555,0.043459464,-0.072864436,0.02789063,0.0058939815,0.0014098334,0.06997615,0.05431194,-0.027972776,-0.018932026,-0.09194553,-0.02909147,-0.023441039,-0.016473679,0.007838394,0.056338523,0.012767823,0.014139824,-0.10043708,0.02732061,-0.062696666,0.014443966,0.013727269,0.041943833,-0.056114193,-5.8516683e-34,-0.035506986,-0.009419007,-0.0015337197,0.08607543,-0.066128485,0.038924713,-0.02006476,0.09073831,-0.027601127,0.0068862587,-0.014741483,0.023006286,0.03619228,0.02384143,0.034627855,-0.03261005,-0.042045143,0.01733005,0.05778775,0.053706553,0.061623655,-0.016039535,-0.047556546,-0.056756355,-0.02135684,0.078680225,-0.061430242,-0.017556148,-0.084808,0.039170668,0.0011940007,-0.008076104,0.003985345,-0.012813717,-0.013708198,0.0219437,-0.018120874,-0.043583404,-0.0012225248,0.023236146,-0.04869977,0.045353588,-0.13499995,-0.0316324,-0.035141136,-0.04233519,0.04244765,0.03927861,0.013068481,-0.046290997,0.036353845,-0.0010854971,0.005037126,0.0064928946,-0.066872574,0.06535425,-0.052677207,0.020607157,-0.031866003,0.026525334,0.03768089,0.03594632,-0.025685035,0.035657622,-0.03637151,-0.08684768,0.027523903,0.012030685,-0.08138498,0.05165004,-0.029768687,0.012471583,-0.018728595,0.019580694,-0.075327724,-0.027086154,0.013378696,-0.0013276661,-0.037240762,-0.025101023,0.016204773,-0.026728401,0.0055589634,0.1060358,0.023641981,0.008791648,0.09477742,0.008640478,0.038067497,0.034297936,0.005952039,0.012306811,-0.061453428,0.074148044,-0.09445276,-4.9305264e-08,-0.070403226,0.0028623217,0.021838995,-0.0516866,-0.023357095,0.04876514,-0.05399593,0.078431256,-0.10488907,0.039654724,0.04190097,-0.01528073,-0.18601497,-0.008930381,0.025292752,0.029519044,0.027528692,0.13589258,-0.023490539,0.06320962,-0.031071441,-0.0051719355,0.034302544,-0.03745989,0.006156121,-0.05900388,0.045004107,0.092218466,-0.03039121,-0.023640478,-0.041622896,0.005956705,-0.004351057,0.009072515,0.0043004234,0.12259446,-0.069841444,-0.010297611,-0.08556534,0.06524576,-0.0020044583,0.13449559,-0.040657613,0.021199202,0.04667217,0.08408288,0.02760141,0.033199877,-0.030424992,-0.008721938,-0.011353452,0.006850727,-0.11647145,0.009963541,-0.046158932,-0.032816503,-0.08018921,-0.11510755,0.014795566,0.07600803,0.013950676,-0.061721176,0.04841935,-0.006250378,7,10.262664,-30.130127,4
626,"the class began with a quick review of gradient descent and then moved to logistic regression.
the confusion matrix was explained, and the teacher showed a website to try neural network clustering.
after that, students looked at logistic regression code and learned about important measures like precision, recall, and the f1 score.
the roc curve was introduced, where the x-axis shows the false positive rate (fpr) and the y-axis shows the true positive rate (tpr).
it was also said that each class has its own roc curve.
next, the session moved to clustering, starting with k-means, where the number of groups is decided before.
in the end, the discussion moved to hierarchical clustering and different ways to do clustering were explained.

630,"playground.tensorflow.org- allows us to play with datasets and helps us understands how classification happens. if we want to get a non linear boundary in logistic regression, we need to add new variable such as x1^2,x1^3 and so on. by adding a node in hidden layer in neural network we can get a better boundary. next sir went on to code where he explained about logistic regression implementation and test metrics. don't believe the accuracy values, see other values in confusion metrics and other test metrics. true positive rate(trp)= (tp)/(fn+tp). receiver operating characteristic curve(roc) curve- it is a plot of tpr against fpr for different thresholds(value at which we change classes for eg if p>=0.5 => class 1 else class 0). the area under this curve measures how well the model can distinguish between two groups. so base roc curve we can find threshold values. in roc plot there is a 45 degree line which occurs when we randomly classify data. so when our plot is more close to this 45 degree line then our classification is more worse. auc should be as close to 1 as possible for good classification. the classifier also depends on the quality of data. if the data itself is intermeshed, any classifier wont be able to get a proper boundary.  for such datasets we can carry out data separation by using some transformations. any kind of fraud that is occurring is an example of data imbalance. precision: of the observations that have been detected as class 1 how many actually belong to class 1. so if there are multiple values there will be multiple precision values. support- how many values have been classified as a particular class. when there is a class imbalance, it will be difficult to detect anomalies. if we have multiple classes, we have multiple roc curves. many times problems will be easier to convert a regression problem into a classification problem by binning. 
clustering: unsupervised. we don't have labelled data. we will only have features. we will have to detect potential number of classes and number of points in each class. we will see at k means clustering and hierarchal clustering. metrics part is homework, we will only look at algorithms in class. in k means clustering number of cluster is an input we need to give. in hierarchical clustering we get a dendrogram in which we will be able to know how clusters can be formed based on closeness of groups of data. after clustering we will be able to identify some outliers. clustering is usually done as a part of exploratory data analysis. algorithms are explained step by step in  slides. k-means - you are trying to identify k mean points around which a cluster can be formed. we need to specify desired number of clusters. sir then explained how this works step by step. step-1:distance calculation and reassignment of clusters. step-2,3: cluster re assignment. initial cluster assignments are random. so we run this multiple times to get a nice model. hierarchical clustering- each observation is a cluster and identify which clusters are close to each other. this group goes on till we get one cluster. we can cut the grouping at any point to get required number of clusters. by default euclidean metrics is used as default, distance between clusters is small.",0.021718008,-0.09525372,-0.040380586,0.0058484934,0.09260762,-0.114137895,0.013711734,0.045419786,0.011280308,-0.01748601,-0.035245527,-0.056640618,-0.054108955,0.050194446,-0.00868663,-0.08994484,0.050409466,-0.0010672911,-0.0732257,0.07729776,0.025568282,0.03599257,0.004896675,0.07818156,-0.048590094,-0.14128458,-0.031072302,0.002346507,-0.013994936,-0.012017826,-0.0030874864,0.009707818,0.04247376,0.050667495,-0.06982228,-0.04151435,-0.026835198,0.010851664,0.010109223,-0.03734823,-0.0035395909,-0.056951545,0.03894,0.010665259,0.0646241,0.034788467,-0.040287443,0.023805788,-0.04575438,0.0067728516,-0.0030718923,0.050132383,0.02663568,-0.0036477223,-0.17149869,0.07103325,0.041839823,-0.039903946,-0.025445856,-0.017293725,-0.0064658024,-0.036379308,-0.019692894,-0.06748231,0.06699427,-0.032372538,-0.05359104,0.02643371,0.085379876,0.08880579,0.04150865,-0.028658334,-0.013514176,0.004312851,0.029685572,0.025147283,0.06617006,0.0679543,-0.0043545025,-0.00538035,0.04093023,0.026010692,-0.0032752608,0.0085224435,0.05484807,-0.085275605,0.08465853,0.008740822,-0.03461984,0.03339624,0.030614655,0.041961193,-0.044167094,-0.0033089286,0.013907053,0.026586857,-0.026757924,-0.020975262,-0.031361636,0.011641077,-0.054604445,-0.031627446,-0.00457309,0.007944246,0.059843782,0.043412026,0.04843711,-0.0022533443,0.06356087,0.031042945,0.0436618,0.074151315,-0.10104816,0.006809409,0.110333696,0.0039047485,-0.01003006,0.026211452,-0.039994467,0.0861733,-0.071508124,0.014349303,-0.05017604,-0.008448051,0.05548463,0.012093068,-0.07734897,8.572122e-33,-0.03319452,0.06589105,-0.036628824,-0.08765051,-0.005721523,0.029370148,-0.06676779,0.01252148,0.043375123,0.11808301,-0.1332218,0.013943736,0.0455106,0.10021711,0.06262877,-0.063518085,-0.10434021,-0.016329592,-0.007815154,0.03700512,-0.0071757482,-0.019803459,0.028679715,-0.079437,0.046409663,-0.0012868564,-0.07066069,0.08422173,-0.051761515,0.021580985,-0.02107561,-0.0027599502,0.016285088,-0.042386603,0.094024554,0.06397922,-0.03485505,0.027118012,0.0026626983,-0.0034637793,-0.057910405,0.029178394,-0.013514453,0.033183005,-0.0027147327,-0.04512013,-0.018485645,-0.030807741,-0.044721115,-0.0057214173,-0.006508618,-0.034445528,-0.046774253,0.013260266,-0.008788813,-0.0030514696,0.0348631,-0.018892532,0.012194535,0.042110756,0.07798151,-0.06822015,0.0010169217,-0.042003907,-0.03605253,0.026435494,0.012353475,0.016128138,0.029923063,-0.032154206,-0.068419956,0.034607463,0.031294417,-0.018089324,0.029572824,0.037793998,0.042706143,0.019965338,0.008839957,-0.011530926,-0.08683062,0.07712682,-0.0025043942,-0.047597107,-0.06378109,-0.0012199676,-0.004904274,0.056961738,-0.093025155,0.0024122922,-0.019955797,0.06667609,0.053159002,0.07627332,-0.05155382,-9.1334706e-33,-0.015671734,0.038419925,0.013431936,0.0453424,-0.080125354,0.015874617,0.00819324,-0.0008686115,0.0014682012,-0.04475165,0.08408439,0.012627486,-0.0049132747,0.030740878,0.074364565,-0.0071725445,-0.083343446,0.0332038,0.03896897,-0.041509375,0.10128502,0.074677974,-0.11652507,-0.024526117,-0.07474604,-0.013242739,-0.09908905,-0.0048377626,0.0023561637,-0.0750569,-0.052929584,0.03698909,-0.042953707,-0.01396887,0.089188114,0.042385574,-0.008689353,-0.039807655,0.04924634,0.061188105,-0.0074274093,0.04930845,-0.018780638,-0.043036792,-0.07114585,0.014528222,0.02261576,0.06699344,0.070013225,0.0065107956,0.07860495,-0.019492526,0.006825779,0.076439604,-0.032846257,0.030240193,-0.058753543,-0.04402229,-0.058923032,0.06679977,-0.038836867,0.06916417,-0.01921328,0.042112906,-0.06469221,-0.054251004,-0.028976245,0.06499877,0.026533468,0.008376398,-0.13015577,0.018749317,0.010990203,0.037329707,-0.024291642,0.016268998,-0.016175486,-0.020451777,-0.022236092,-0.016085438,-0.041556917,-0.015278122,-0.044340596,0.085407265,0.02760645,0.022635182,0.02367454,-0.05729889,0.063041404,0.0023714365,0.049023055,0.015779497,-0.057723492,-0.028722154,-0.031625554,-6.655372e-08,-0.028403962,-0.051794965,0.030279472,-0.018762253,-0.032428894,0.07279836,-0.018099405,0.02841899,-0.08010147,0.029811993,0.0216159,0.044095956,-0.17671163,-0.088097066,0.016836455,-0.005104561,-0.03552482,0.08717313,0.024354646,-0.012808648,-0.036132716,-0.0242482,-0.008975173,-0.059825867,0.030166574,-0.045242943,-0.019723626,0.06510003,-0.111189745,-0.00013490206,0.07447491,0.003048412,-0.008543141,0.05381606,0.10176093,0.1632116,0.0034525616,-0.056921065,-0.06905258,0.09950063,-0.040911186,0.042731155,-0.03627989,-0.057752077,-0.020496964,-0.022689367,0.055351287,0.021535996,-0.037334688,-0.002952297,0.0012512669,0.06790428,-0.07816551,0.034957368,0.01719326,0.015587954,-0.052117728,-0.13398248,-0.07473228,0.10802985,-0.019142231,0.01411359,-0.003099181,-0.061327163,7,4.8424845,-33.048187,4

644,"we started the discussion with logistic regression. we saw the logistic regression model in the sklearn library. how to implement it etc. logit_regression score gives the accuracy of the fit. but accuracy of the model is not a good metric to decide whether the model is good or bad. hence we make a confusion matrix. by this we get the false positives false negatives etc. using this we can get the recall, precision and f1-score by these which are a better metric to decide whether a model is good or bad. then we discussed about roc curve which tells when the classifier starts detecting incorrect values/false positives. auc signifies area under the roc curve. we need to set thresholds on classifier best classifier will have an auc tending to 1 and worst will have an auc tending to 0.5. 

then we touched the topic of feature engineering and feature transformation. we also discussed that if there is a class imbalance in the dataset then the classifier will not be able to perform well and generalize well.

then we discussed clustering algorithms which are a class of unsupervised learning. we discussed to methods:
1) heirarchial clustering - make dendograms
2) kmeans clustering - randomly initiate centroids and then reassign based on distances. we initially declare that how many clusters we want to achieve and then finally reach that target.

then we also talked about sillhoutte score which tells whether the ckustering is good or not.",-0.043206565,-0.08273131,-0.08740408,0.020449055,0.09560205,-0.03545296,0.012226118,0.030518157,-0.04569448,0.010594493,-0.0038911034,-0.061377663,-0.0027163648,0.08697794,-0.07009878,-0.06276399,0.0384923,0.06706678,-0.04574227,0.0449719,0.047402706,0.0358776,0.036615454,0.14088221,-0.049560934,-0.03793843,0.026337534,-0.06702859,-0.10501075,-0.039879378,-0.037295144,0.012138111,0.030808028,0.019348884,-0.06058102,-0.009698551,0.04924532,0.04801426,-0.021895897,-0.05048689,-0.029921394,-0.0588525,-0.00017731643,-0.008349764,0.035897966,0.030156681,-0.111238144,0.0424158,-0.04762609,-0.0008084871,0.003719112,0.032125797,-0.054010395,-0.013019237,-0.08998575,0.06837746,0.033951417,-0.02009255,0.069076784,-0.03034966,0.05286297,-0.07174239,-0.01140869,-0.030624842,-0.004524672,0.0020589072,-0.037820775,0.009264233,0.084348224,0.068557106,0.010349061,-0.01146037,0.0095014125,0.047125094,0.030578565,0.05201439,0.06549015,0.075985916,0.058243886,0.056356315,-0.0031393673,0.06660827,0.02121423,0.018454071,0.12959239,-0.05713055,0.04554939,-0.02419317,-0.0211573,0.015185354,0.016725676,0.014892582,0.0075810933,-0.07574995,-0.009025433,0.002905067,-0.0041112145,-0.056782417,0.053415675,0.0522645,-0.08279933,0.056101345,-0.00013570688,-0.07523082,0.085276745,-0.025139427,0.013575822,0.026417503,0.091698624,0.04543496,0.03892232,0.0257174,-0.11076649,-0.034787193,0.052719004,0.04828801,0.06483494,0.028364826,-0.06856331,0.08541303,-0.029639227,-0.023590527,0.024054952,0.04737916,0.12461602,-0.01442064,-0.11035111,3.638242e-33,-0.066235855,0.0023488104,0.005371035,-0.08033979,-0.0236087,-0.05311687,-0.09547839,0.015676362,0.07869158,-0.01324994,-0.01245218,0.072265506,0.03806791,0.06850455,0.09958439,-0.023356427,-0.023514595,-0.012724624,-0.042256095,-0.053813495,0.04564516,-0.026729327,0.056925643,-0.03959591,-0.017023893,0.00012015702,-0.027759865,-0.017612783,-0.011278336,0.03320752,-0.026724376,-0.031102939,0.030132672,0.02008718,0.007952377,0.032096323,-0.040361006,-0.04798123,0.041718673,0.0027757897,-0.02779294,0.0066151903,0.007640816,-0.034010414,0.03767607,0.04512563,0.043142594,0.031538002,-0.03332458,-0.010858741,0.029167783,-0.11092531,-0.009252984,0.040378675,-0.052352052,0.048388135,0.02555305,-0.06232518,-0.011507867,0.00555697,0.06455773,-0.07446314,-0.002830243,-0.05673627,-0.06468062,-0.08260323,0.041104127,0.06277426,-0.012812513,-0.04895019,-0.04966577,0.03799465,-0.021379117,0.026335694,-0.04077331,0.062480483,0.06268667,0.03776373,-0.06515101,-0.0055671823,-0.036681905,0.010967837,-0.061843783,-0.04488331,0.04484644,0.01401226,-0.005085164,0.026921375,-0.111957975,0.028796205,-0.05914337,-0.0035394637,0.058563683,0.052955694,-0.020722046,-3.389485e-33,-0.03625914,-0.04338397,-0.0045448416,0.081842154,-0.013458395,0.017221237,-0.027621247,0.048915654,-0.044709325,-0.073752224,0.0018817374,-0.017188348,0.04625869,0.054939624,-0.04206745,0.021747494,-0.050256316,0.01576293,0.027193528,0.0474314,0.035295136,0.10794213,-0.08787569,-0.037605174,-0.04166425,0.0524125,-0.08454956,0.05240253,-0.018747274,0.038243655,-0.026576113,0.09685615,-0.024723727,0.021282839,0.03471516,-0.0051958654,-0.026777875,-0.052341633,0.00043224986,0.08872058,0.011548916,0.07331951,-0.12605718,-0.011051093,-0.010915435,-0.06925748,0.072058335,0.09460542,0.01007027,-0.035505455,-0.0054352647,-0.06441923,0.02432769,0.120259985,-0.062943295,0.071763955,-0.007974028,-0.026464589,-0.0530127,0.062098768,-0.05598776,0.025627563,-0.00013027564,0.016066289,-0.031593297,-0.08489009,0.03577228,0.094022445,-0.06947576,0.023254963,-0.03127283,0.0062862886,0.052034907,-0.011858353,-0.039289717,-0.040961653,0.02195055,0.0065663788,-0.027202489,-0.041623857,-0.05165533,0.0025550826,-0.040354963,0.11788342,-0.0036800464,0.03783672,0.09198985,0.027008394,0.045889143,0.00391623,-0.043497402,0.053196136,0.010418972,0.03309636,-0.041348066,-5.643925e-08,-0.021004774,0.011723704,0.019270178,-0.04665072,0.0122740595,0.011793687,-0.086289965,0.09004633,-0.11047954,-0.013545275,-0.004429936,0.01464685,-0.13643524,-0.04863345,-0.0012220715,0.04035309,0.07024453,0.14634512,-0.033728775,-0.02006609,-0.002539584,-0.06300423,0.031085404,0.01117927,0.0007834525,-0.095889084,0.029226184,0.040307596,-0.03571316,0.018893857,-0.053575773,0.014637037,0.038454384,0.039520882,0.057012342,0.13428558,-0.016467195,-0.046040636,-0.06970897,0.038187835,0.040466804,0.071182236,-0.078330934,-0.01866013,-0.043563593,-0.0072442377,0.042621806,-0.002838085,0.018630998,0.014286088,-0.01816809,0.043046497,-0.065374784,0.047570594,0.009038173,0.0679566,-0.05842806,-0.10205788,0.024383869,0.0775626,0.01011922,-0.023701454,0.0057983883,0.019516315,7,9.140592,-30.512478,4
648,"today's session explored key machine learning concepts, starting with optimization and recall parameters. we examined how regression problems can sometimes be reframed as classification tasks, though the reverse isnâ€™t feasible due to information loss. in unsupervised learning, we covered clustering techniques, including hierarchical clustering, which organizes data into a tree-like structure using a dendrogram, and k-means clustering, where points are iteratively assigned to predefined clusters based on their proximity to centroids. we then experimented with neural networks using tensorflow playground, adjusting parameters to observe changes in predictions. lastly, we discussed classification metrics such as auc-roc, which evaluates model performance by comparing true and false positive rates, and explored how transformations and feature engineering can enhance data separation, making classification models more effective than simple regression.",-0.066792145,-0.07564672,-0.02557727,0.06644738,0.09850972,0.0044543226,0.0032306146,-0.04869521,-0.04398966,-0.024732012,-0.02513882,0.013426338,0.01822654,0.008685801,-0.023928117,-0.058801405,0.013743736,0.029602781,-0.078808226,-0.038145002,0.025048506,0.038752615,-0.005578224,0.120379195,0.07053867,0.049222734,0.0539468,-0.029103845,-0.0557727,-0.024477303,0.06543797,-0.019518834,-0.0073618907,0.029937163,-0.08444723,0.05571749,-0.004373867,0.036981467,-0.091405176,-0.07873394,-0.010529276,-0.013024055,-0.03992848,0.022533972,0.07700531,0.10244571,-0.050534062,0.02155524,-0.010357482,-0.016623555,-0.04546957,0.007596278,-0.042951476,0.042596124,-0.10601655,0.07558197,0.030030428,0.023231566,0.0106668165,-0.012303374,0.019090712,-0.08628289,0.0338262,-0.005200561,-0.0017847935,0.037636567,-0.007083912,0.032095615,0.06630755,0.025499651,0.03507135,0.06779716,-0.043959703,0.009897097,0.011232678,0.041604433,0.049944803,0.016204331,0.04534965,0.041149586,-0.016780103,0.026135478,0.006611065,0.041796353,0.13225996,-0.035007406,0.00017083346,0.021135772,-0.05416616,-0.018390512,-0.017764425,-0.021426685,0.047324486,-0.04071285,-0.0115475515,-0.031530816,-0.0013906826,-0.10082821,-0.023041125,0.0794622,-0.07646444,0.12977196,0.016643222,-0.09652703,0.0074027525,0.0017595552,0.020922003,0.01499293,0.06395486,0.034191202,0.015919823,0.07059611,-0.046506304,-0.04312808,0.039995354,0.010208853,0.05067285,0.039425593,-0.010537321,0.09773331,0.016382527,-0.065842025,-0.033213615,0.06512301,0.043021288,0.011951501,-0.14396541,4.3189106e-33,-0.058898903,-0.067544445,-0.0066665453,-0.0069871577,0.052539423,-0.036809288,-0.078705974,0.062144548,0.06526222,0.02310534,-0.010880264,0.060560018,0.015774686,0.06737769,0.090400316,0.0026391584,-0.06088889,0.092159204,-0.053389292,-0.12346277,-0.01649607,-0.025246536,0.061691638,-0.034961347,-0.024955982,-0.004774458,-0.0055783885,-0.033108167,0.010225192,0.0051520304,-0.05304534,-0.03959012,-0.031010875,0.028184071,0.07827117,0.05107485,-0.0126066,-0.0920901,0.03144664,0.022484729,-0.06283576,-0.0011722618,0.0102828955,-0.062058188,-0.039178334,-0.055984866,-0.018406963,-0.041069627,-0.0061591812,-0.056308612,-0.026876772,-0.058294415,-0.009977777,-0.018462637,-0.048503004,0.02521592,0.028633276,0.0063230516,-0.015632333,0.027189182,-0.015155303,0.031227661,0.017708916,0.02048869,-0.056815915,-0.03315541,0.032960374,0.18328723,0.09141195,0.0014865487,-0.009644248,0.055444483,-0.009960673,0.007636548,0.021845477,0.08307642,0.09245015,-0.00623197,-0.019348072,-0.011743675,0.014305817,-0.0005376368,-0.019922962,-0.030874154,-0.01680574,-0.011442578,0.06178014,0.0073834998,-0.12245678,0.01862701,-0.1274619,0.041281648,0.035694093,0.03182386,-0.04914198,-4.297814e-33,-0.06303055,0.021212157,-0.021660864,0.004782119,-0.033235338,0.05384924,-0.013966834,0.046169303,-0.025154114,-0.059369247,-0.03487625,-0.0035522687,0.04160991,-0.026180685,-0.012284629,-0.009481949,-0.032852225,0.030801069,-0.0152882645,0.013619294,-0.051634368,0.056039035,-0.06715407,0.025684124,-0.12737514,-0.0061180713,-0.061465975,0.034009997,-0.033045262,0.03599939,-0.04158789,0.040397696,-0.009764248,0.019336259,-0.014803685,-0.006065998,-0.040394276,-0.05536499,-0.021406993,0.081145525,0.0017090031,0.08024683,-0.13105732,-0.015065719,-0.015220854,-0.059922017,0.034701526,0.07370648,0.0061388104,-0.01631447,0.027548049,-0.0074262503,-0.0581308,-0.019960029,-0.054187223,0.014480102,-0.03327694,-0.023872254,0.031059833,0.030290952,-0.048798606,-0.019604702,0.019457951,0.015853552,-0.016437056,-0.11696573,0.046096556,0.06008724,-0.025893513,0.025745368,-0.034811005,-0.013900397,0.021635229,0.02798309,-0.08101219,-0.055402383,0.025147626,-0.046088852,-0.06260191,-0.029683614,0.025540676,-0.05176507,-0.026395027,0.08333647,0.07129439,0.078599736,0.05216935,0.08867821,0.09036507,0.014737457,-0.07091686,0.065072894,-0.014880986,0.044863403,-0.0028632365,-4.4719574e-08,-0.028557712,0.06831367,0.037522357,0.025515338,-0.065184936,-0.044874765,-0.012509534,0.17965929,-0.07950546,-0.0026573332,0.038392946,-0.029782597,-0.10372356,0.03242434,-0.009433751,0.03144923,0.031173406,0.10518863,-0.0020242,-0.0013809674,0.05710561,-0.044542506,0.036830723,0.016325345,0.037393942,-0.13353287,0.035937972,0.12262833,-0.04456591,0.036282342,-0.032267693,0.010012769,0.0014023744,0.023583274,0.018020177,0.100408755,0.044635717,0.030940825,-0.06955359,-0.031994835,-0.06663728,0.11891739,-0.076111384,0.04716235,-0.05071671,0.043004885,0.07583025,0.01819404,0.03258124,-0.016084246,0.04637353,0.018218728,0.029108942,0.0038866096,0.048860557,0.048894968,-0.048163902,-0.07041303,0.0023630061,0.024323676,0.05976248,-0.03679035,-0.0417559,-0.000908601,7,7.558389,-29.603481,4
