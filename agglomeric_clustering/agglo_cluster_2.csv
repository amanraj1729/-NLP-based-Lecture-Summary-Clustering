7,"in class, we started by talking about how to measure key population parameters like the mean and variance.
sir used an example to explain the central limit theorem, where we tried to estimate the extra work hours of managers in a company. we worked with a small sample of 18 observations, assuming it represented the whole population, and then we plotted the probability density function (pdf) for the sample mean.
after that, we learned about confidence intervals, and how we use the t-distribution when our sample size is less than 3, sir also explained why confidence intervals are so useful in real lifeâ€”they help us make better decisions based on data. 
we touched on other important statistical terms, like t-values and z-values, and how to calculate them. we also discussed what it means when results are â€œstatistically different,â€ or when we can confidently say that two things are significantly different based on statistical tests.

13,"first we calculate sample mean,which is considered the approximate of population mean ,then std dev of population is calculated by dividing population std dev by the root of sample space and when the sample size is less we can use t-statistic instead of normal distribution,then we do linear regression as y=b0+b1x and we use hypothesis testing to check for dependency on the variable and if p-value is less than 0.05 then it can be concluded that the coefficient is not 0. anova compares the statistical equivalence of multiple means or variables.
the f-statistic is the ratio of the mean square regression (msr) to the mean square error (mse), used to evaluate the overall model significance.",0.079960905,0.05227366,-0.03503852,0.03333634,-0.0007649798,0.050858602,-0.099702984,0.09297588,0.07895268,0.099251114,0.06109938,-0.058195896,-0.06748784,0.013858916,-0.060979553,-0.10024954,0.0024906711,-0.041516475,0.010690648,0.024120478,0.051974382,-0.023686014,0.06105428,0.015836688,-0.043515973,0.0010845857,-0.07840486,0.0074172663,-0.0013815187,0.047369465,0.045961026,0.06881741,0.039635986,0.05192052,-0.034452647,-0.0306942,-0.03203467,-0.0069760196,0.0036258262,0.042162295,-0.07430416,-0.056717917,0.027587218,-0.022715146,0.015868962,-0.043607894,-0.052086744,0.03741693,-0.10562232,0.054401204,0.03993265,0.040811826,-0.079791054,-0.031669613,-0.02351896,-0.06647937,0.0046837335,-0.075825065,0.011096844,0.04772378,0.03354234,0.0079240445,0.011619837,0.05471701,0.06269721,0.07390291,-0.047118764,-0.09082946,-0.025881942,-0.030668162,-0.023298694,-0.030475076,-0.034614418,-0.028893588,0.04263075,-0.028937032,-0.030151512,0.041146584,0.0030729312,0.022932326,0.071324825,-0.00683411,-0.08728069,-0.0017682308,0.04221619,0.048160534,-0.00018349905,0.041692715,-0.09438534,0.04318637,-0.0014075559,0.109165356,-0.11403961,0.050848126,-0.069041096,0.033959165,-0.08088207,-0.0030084997,0.056251436,-0.02461685,-0.03223343,0.054073747,0.06546161,-0.025259705,-0.047251407,0.03630623,0.06364636,-0.09091942,0.05061298,-0.039291747,-0.039922677,0.0048669446,-0.035411995,0.049246,0.060809948,-0.11376686,-0.021292523,0.051611114,0.041443262,-0.021979416,0.08744375,-0.020811806,-0.014178949,0.0341624,0.023111109,0.024076873,-0.12655993,6.0730318e-33,-0.021887654,0.0048449007,0.0097508775,0.07712382,-0.029154798,-0.030666512,0.030900214,0.018165872,0.048547924,0.025174867,-0.035809673,-0.052695956,-0.04245843,-0.012203689,0.09268516,0.013797913,0.042415004,-0.017239839,-0.039663628,0.018560676,0.068314366,-0.051589377,0.059426893,0.022194518,0.08880611,-0.035823375,-0.079500474,0.05972678,-0.06557118,-0.03369433,-0.026132869,0.0050728316,-0.052254956,-0.054681078,0.023055704,-0.03668843,0.020280492,0.029836018,-0.05312532,0.03468055,-0.04619608,0.04369517,0.026874488,0.011456916,0.051809307,0.027464978,-0.019987611,-0.04167754,0.05034996,0.073403314,-0.010885356,0.02559204,-0.056663483,0.060039077,-0.0062202606,0.03262073,-0.046166804,-0.0011209737,-0.052777562,0.042423073,0.016383426,0.00534936,-0.016207952,-0.026479403,0.041778427,0.05095242,0.10918225,0.039856736,0.046030663,0.015318375,0.044259764,-0.0037994226,0.0052348664,0.008655282,-0.003919652,0.023586519,0.033076312,-0.058039445,0.058812015,-0.10685684,-0.021750238,-0.01699446,-0.09129232,-0.063602984,-0.019536223,-0.022965625,-0.006276359,0.015295271,0.04636323,-0.047320835,0.05686972,0.006368598,-0.08429918,-0.029542873,-0.016820429,-6.990368e-33,-0.044155274,0.051287696,-0.0037654242,0.0032403255,-0.03902719,0.018144174,0.0642976,-0.055726867,0.04382672,-0.024972865,-0.035739645,-0.0202529,0.052467972,-0.036611985,0.021157712,0.06618878,0.05156103,-0.06257118,-0.07394063,0.038290247,-0.028354295,0.105279945,0.0769812,-0.04325229,-0.058415573,0.04939169,-0.08268346,-0.04474357,-0.011396574,-0.08027596,0.08206817,0.0026753794,-0.051978905,-0.08088738,-0.00058858417,0.010560909,0.03003886,0.051282253,0.057187088,0.0047742045,0.07065253,0.12416606,0.017399218,-0.0685481,0.027735632,0.09279088,0.005272097,-0.02817001,0.07669478,-0.05238278,0.012668655,0.053257477,-0.0026043567,-0.0069001666,-0.04467966,-0.05137681,0.032993205,-0.07279487,-0.09723567,0.018868936,0.031283516,-0.06908456,-0.03559759,0.024282236,-0.0756024,-0.033167902,0.032764368,0.029124249,0.074228555,0.04330425,-0.0034743731,-0.04041969,0.01731094,0.025585847,-0.048843484,-0.055295955,-0.044305768,-0.02673845,0.05832609,0.042505607,-0.0023226307,0.018779837,-0.011404545,-0.07513546,-0.044273112,-0.12568909,-0.012106138,-0.06196495,-0.034045737,0.025313487,-0.048107337,0.06456918,-0.03689014,-0.072864465,0.056933817,-5.2987023e-08,0.052251775,-0.07470795,0.025535325,-0.0406488,0.038194783,-0.010009787,-0.028320186,-0.048561424,0.019699674,-0.041522283,-0.05312408,0.03275662,-0.05963616,-0.008553678,-0.016098164,0.0074899327,0.027522592,0.0386157,0.006246354,-0.049738593,-0.037767548,-0.013123869,-0.08943653,0.015322201,0.038070608,0.0014774197,-0.063058294,0.017384715,0.04172947,0.058419798,0.08686859,0.02276067,0.05500051,-0.02016944,0.11439657,0.03135878,0.0817021,0.027219161,0.044682812,0.0712726,-0.04347546,0.0160295,-0.012409785,0.041017197,-0.04246153,-0.025716728,0.03284684,-0.035095986,-0.040052373,-0.04517842,0.06339063,-0.035175614,-0.14082588,0.018130153,-0.13223553,0.049540594,0.03035148,0.087794,0.02576191,-0.16211109,0.048225958,0.048942063,0.052716047,-0.07940402,11,-20.884384,1.7273637,2
23,"we discussed that whatever be the sample distribution, mean distribution is normal. we then defined sample error as sigma/root n where sigma of population is assumed to be close to sample sigma which we know. histogram of these frequency distribution of sample is often divided by total area so that it is made to unity distribution. and when bin size is reduced then histogram smoothens out. confidence interval 95% and t distribution in some cases. in the end discussed multiple regression using anova

bo and b1 are point estimations and we need to arrive at the possible interval within which their value be such that is a very high chance that bop and b1 p will be within intervals respectively",-0.0058703967,-0.05772449,-0.015890067,0.036290985,0.004426811,0.06517216,0.014117614,0.01882223,0.034495804,-0.0039909105,-0.053686567,0.040553898,0.0626489,-0.01611906,0.04590059,-0.03831123,0.0291436,-0.06099511,-0.034258604,-0.03717839,0.0014542046,0.009864459,-0.0020970996,-0.0053420793,0.007250325,-0.10058838,0.04726187,-0.0071817962,0.028376214,-0.038406026,0.002643929,0.07828923,0.07342409,-0.07249143,-0.03645586,-0.05243885,-0.0075532314,0.018245777,0.02566029,0.016362956,-0.031229243,0.02728831,0.100895666,0.05827919,0.0683989,0.037583146,0.0056599723,-0.041918207,-0.0704267,-0.009266202,-0.040073596,-0.013058947,-0.016275339,-0.04616685,-0.03387878,0.012979335,-0.04437257,0.022844002,0.037920736,0.022107664,-0.05699838,0.024694735,-0.06056365,-0.008238715,0.03379088,-0.028211983,-0.033056755,0.08531917,0.025223034,-0.004880076,-0.09408918,0.048937414,-0.09877756,-0.0123977605,0.04528373,-0.044590022,0.02758622,-0.0779286,0.015297624,-0.036797464,-0.010173852,0.00841974,0.022545837,0.0013620878,-0.00805324,-0.025883313,-0.035281043,0.11218398,-0.060062118,-0.022036849,0.1711088,-0.044124708,-0.09536468,0.08025881,0.041601237,0.010025505,-0.07134392,-0.08094943,0.0895503,0.013802202,0.013573098,-0.040748227,-0.03250648,0.007469457,-0.03989084,-0.06210743,0.062464975,-0.010543147,0.0789166,0.05581969,-0.060346793,-0.03706208,0.015559285,-0.011903905,0.02775616,-0.047790296,-0.025707528,0.018605672,-0.052104704,-0.120399795,0.046234753,-0.0069107213,0.05753813,0.021329064,-0.106863834,0.042472582,-0.0038695307,5.3319873e-33,0.039173216,-0.04421796,0.02880985,0.048380904,0.014875749,0.037305824,-0.06999988,-0.041784767,0.03579831,0.016096069,-0.038542114,0.024088241,-0.0073845116,-0.05433719,0.07361337,0.0062677213,-0.04000789,0.05107334,0.024170954,0.05242254,-0.0015324503,-0.09176226,0.020117337,-0.009276961,0.034163624,0.06479499,0.02113761,0.019864716,-0.049524527,0.022234924,0.011320355,-0.0031132072,-0.13191062,-0.025166627,-0.04230515,-0.07212709,-0.08212657,0.0067051826,-0.028283933,0.011836789,0.063145936,-0.030835548,0.068540715,0.005007546,0.09031892,-0.052400842,0.025540475,0.04613641,-0.025526807,0.015406929,-0.07793156,-0.018110996,-0.023870494,-0.09337668,0.08036337,0.08293494,-0.0393158,0.0083569735,-0.055943128,0.075918235,0.020797916,-0.00091946987,-0.008247477,-0.12298831,-0.012203243,0.14746901,-0.106767125,-0.0625833,0.03699102,0.052323893,0.041950416,-0.004895294,-0.013168629,-0.06399435,-0.045023132,0.034267627,-0.02414699,0.06706424,0.12160617,-0.021390915,-0.013970926,-0.060978394,-0.0054196105,-0.042971943,-0.034277234,-0.02528083,0.056350097,0.015520785,-0.02561051,-0.036994405,-0.04718961,-0.025488144,-0.07085406,0.057232805,0.010240706,-6.5424305e-33,-0.04390483,0.1134923,0.0026748548,-0.0016009926,-0.039616678,-0.010234754,0.04156058,-0.0475717,0.119329706,0.019109637,-0.14874794,-0.017495712,0.001739375,0.03465306,-0.0047356114,-0.013962102,-0.017455224,-0.08916396,-0.028166907,-0.0033189997,0.026996238,-0.016426666,-0.05530581,-0.020336295,-0.03471408,-0.005672049,-0.019579073,0.034434423,-0.07844628,0.023475727,-0.056313153,-0.07441225,-0.020416003,-0.022244126,-0.086789526,0.01179578,0.03625987,-0.0037676012,-0.045508124,0.023736743,0.025807634,-0.006182407,0.0093674995,-0.14606841,0.00054998684,0.020223869,0.06554471,0.08925829,0.017575804,0.012040551,-0.016912023,0.0575455,-0.01819059,0.03631251,-0.06454349,-0.04254257,-0.058649704,-0.019476734,0.08917681,0.056823418,-0.01816859,-0.0027236824,-0.03747715,0.11741136,-0.033815023,0.05753664,-0.0021106622,-0.0071511315,0.06953258,-0.0488784,-0.0030136018,0.028615573,0.06002676,-0.068380624,-0.068013586,-0.019088902,-0.03223724,-0.0631137,0.0013900986,-0.010157984,0.006401593,-0.038388617,0.03695324,0.07060129,-0.019019857,0.056946848,0.020068556,0.023267254,0.068578504,-0.0877219,-0.061422434,0.036317535,-0.067421384,-0.057466093,0.016564611,-4.2803034e-08,-0.12873179,0.0021451558,0.06327683,0.060445152,0.073318675,0.040867485,-0.03863163,0.005240961,0.0070956904,0.02733424,0.003104321,-0.014744948,0.0003335855,-0.025863763,0.09629343,0.08736094,0.045223348,0.029410489,0.0064332886,-0.0043511656,0.11419283,-0.011173577,0.016728504,-0.036690872,0.020441081,-0.014214918,-0.09929915,0.089187086,0.0015296201,0.04098722,0.013607041,-0.0030461517,0.050965793,-0.057875752,0.12775618,0.036253247,-0.0047793337,-0.020071864,-0.016574774,0.03887551,-0.05551997,-0.070095435,0.016913978,0.0455186,0.100324355,0.024373204,0.022694478,0.04674747,-0.01968101,-0.022190347,0.05050256,0.033072297,0.0038335223,0.031328384,0.07873795,0.03932876,-0.012709499,-0.04413831,-0.056872565,0.05957162,0.03224649,0.06449795,-0.07157358,-0.07784211,1,-23.528889,-5.7419133,2
30,"we started with the talk for trying to evaluate the various population parameters like mean, variance, etc. sir emphasized on the central limit theorem oven a counter example of estimating the extra work hours 1of managers of a particular company where we considered a small single sample of 18 observations which was assumed to represent the population futher we plotted the pdf for the sample mean and later learnt about confidence intervals and the use of t distribution when the observation count is less than 30. further sir explained the practical significance of confidence intervals. moving on sir discussed other statical parameters like t value, z, etc and how to calculate them. also the term ""statistically different"" was introduced. the class ended with discussion on p value and sir briefly introduced multiple linear

44,"1. from the given dataset, we visualised the given dataset in the form of scatterplot and fitted a regression line by calculating constants (slopes and intercept) for the regression line from the data itself in excel
2. next we plotted the errors and visualised the errors in the form of histograms and learnt that for the errors to be random, the errors must be distributed so that their pattern cant be predicted
3. we then discussed that if the errors arent randomly distributed, the model isnt that good and has more scopes of improvement
4. then we discussed the population and sample distribution, the more the representative of population the samplr is, the more its mean is expected to be near the population mean
5. we then utilised data analysis toolpack, and performed linear regression on the original dataset and introduced ourselves to various metric such as confidence interval, r-square (r2), standard error etc
6. the variance of data (y or dependent variable) gives rise to the sse and ssr, the and the equation r2 + sse/sst = 1, implies that r2 which is the square of corelation cefficient, the closer it is to one for a simple linear regression model, the good the model is
7. we also then discussed anout the relation beween standard deviation and variance, the relation between standard deviation of population to the sample that is sigma/sqrt(n).",-0.025353732,-0.033014897,-0.03097212,0.016544385,0.0017236242,0.056502346,-0.062427953,0.066422544,0.010529175,0.024403583,0.04241225,-0.036142204,0.064961754,-0.05239481,-0.030889032,-0.054895505,0.05575381,-0.016485145,-0.07196926,-0.047221463,0.061671447,0.0051737637,-0.039399277,0.0075385696,0.08423075,-0.07934685,-0.0122419745,-0.047100186,-0.052148785,0.02338179,0.10666277,0.015385596,0.04364517,0.01893455,-0.07578203,-0.06383361,0.033586733,0.06971042,0.03722648,0.061107554,-0.020195518,0.018236188,0.039423253,-0.011063863,-0.00215859,-0.0006886729,-0.009971466,-0.015345092,-0.031929895,0.05401956,-0.08703345,-0.017511286,0.011825632,-0.05407629,0.03893929,-0.088110626,-0.04336414,-0.116749756,0.09846626,0.0023194917,0.046773467,-0.025277253,-0.00258945,-0.010349009,0.05586244,0.0089066,-0.031544097,0.00057971873,0.046878025,0.018618695,-0.06257586,0.03860039,-0.10894139,0.040582743,-0.016290735,-0.045478087,-0.07452027,-0.008586929,0.012376544,-0.075331375,0.082891636,0.0897563,0.015114947,0.027512638,-0.016647825,-0.012990514,0.06909071,0.015337924,-0.06447954,0.015771192,0.064228915,0.06116774,-0.079354644,0.02481411,-0.06431712,0.049450967,-0.045544926,-0.09938158,0.07647139,0.037762538,0.037326243,0.06647491,0.047590703,-0.03978298,-0.044776395,-0.03890878,0.043139886,-0.002686285,-0.050483227,0.0036376577,-0.035641767,-0.018775687,-0.16447888,0.06372576,0.04888829,-0.05367722,-0.046779964,0.0095973825,-0.075205855,0.033444993,0.037759356,0.07119239,0.038686123,0.0029060114,0.055997945,0.023304427,-0.103557855,5.6534953e-33,-0.019643202,0.02392657,-0.06586566,0.022717925,0.006312865,-0.034498766,-0.09364778,-0.035107173,0.060641512,0.047647912,-0.041652717,-0.075677104,0.015302624,-0.0037923006,0.06832964,0.008856642,0.024827942,0.024014909,-0.11788027,0.06289872,-0.061051853,-0.07511072,0.026145168,-0.030901205,0.034909286,-0.004001507,0.031878114,0.0036894265,0.040175356,0.00094577903,0.015744144,0.08342863,0.0029182232,-0.036717895,-0.03480276,-0.073509894,0.053244103,-0.0089110825,0.0069341823,0.06259243,0.06797248,0.04535888,0.05915458,0.08490861,0.076791614,0.068120055,0.027807673,0.021093948,0.052795313,0.021866003,-0.05665038,0.016271759,-0.0011565308,0.02278787,0.022661055,0.11023812,-0.044549923,0.015639858,-0.015716935,0.06751222,-0.094687685,-0.07642362,0.025539689,-0.016524624,0.109927565,0.032696415,-0.011489496,0.0017698954,0.018895326,0.05717448,0.030697607,-0.037673652,-0.007974362,0.096346654,-0.0069173104,-0.01922167,0.025717665,0.108955175,-0.03385932,-0.045410473,-0.02325599,0.023200588,-0.12939015,-0.09704906,-0.043472223,-0.014844061,0.04925372,0.002958866,-0.01447958,0.011894667,-0.028847054,-0.014275549,-0.05048938,0.025919763,-0.077205114,-6.737255e-33,-0.061821703,0.13527332,0.028233517,0.06994974,-0.010698096,0.027448757,0.048780262,0.007293955,0.0037121836,-0.0014623633,-0.061772592,-0.055312086,0.09611051,0.057697345,0.026479986,0.014845831,0.07463095,-0.030343212,-0.05909311,-0.06748621,0.007139471,0.0575167,-0.024844134,-0.0147870965,0.00054087886,0.074502245,-0.12802938,0.060324766,-0.078792706,-0.074271396,0.0038469331,0.0063647944,-0.07490985,-0.10359143,-0.049299296,0.032755483,0.028359605,-0.009907245,-0.060455747,0.029366573,0.05398462,0.06977098,-0.034028027,-0.06839979,0.022445181,0.07462799,0.05129951,0.009554756,0.060934253,-0.012531543,-0.009136779,0.049132515,-0.08556553,0.058175996,0.018236246,-0.04724536,-0.0067184255,-0.062659204,-0.086964205,-0.0028388596,-0.054960303,-0.036570694,-0.029132804,0.010229232,-0.0067763743,-0.013358228,0.03593816,-0.039828587,0.091428556,0.030732872,-0.02135117,-0.06509509,0.06581934,-0.054935195,0.008532081,0.021602405,-0.055600736,-0.030979702,0.005560279,0.04481125,-0.050751075,-0.04321148,0.022528565,-0.054073058,-0.0361896,-0.06628696,0.042926818,-0.025143778,0.04454216,0.038211133,-0.09660371,0.026747307,-0.06400979,-0.013932474,0.018980986,-6.727517e-08,0.076293856,0.032196928,0.022720102,-0.036230773,0.029764047,0.06278153,-0.083743565,0.03229019,-0.04302235,-0.03337923,0.029883938,-0.058426246,-0.088058405,-0.002242962,0.006710205,0.04745776,0.0054458864,0.06186348,-0.040045056,-0.04643624,0.005608921,0.031566963,-0.010962657,-0.01687298,0.057787642,0.0057535563,0.016948868,0.05558664,-0.041204512,0.050699696,0.0018435371,-0.03681602,0.016129306,-0.05738986,0.039049335,-0.030867908,0.007357179,0.019864066,0.10152755,0.06807422,0.020545673,-6.9621324e-06,-0.10160024,0.06840797,0.07279379,-0.0066398983,0.018788427,-0.032225616,0.025965007,-0.10907008,-0.03307244,-0.10310412,-0.017524775,0.064988196,0.018161671,0.026495304,-0.06493223,0.029395662,0.003832207,0.01047261,-0.021137591,0.014520103,-0.04940243,-0.05714712,10,-24.816286,7.582436,2
47,"in today's session we worked on a given data in excel and plotted a scatter plot for respective x and y values, establishing the relationship between the two variables for equation y = a + bx. and using linear regression formulas calculated the parameters and plotted regression line. then we explored many regression metrics such as sse( sum of squares errors), mse( mean squared error ), rmse ( root mean squared error), and mae ( mean absolute error) to assess how the linear regression model is performing. these metrics helped to know the accuracy of the model built by comparing the actual and predicted values. also we learnt that the coefficients which aare. derived from sample data are the estimates population parameters.

we also understood the concept of sampling distributions wherein multiple representative samples drawn from the population and then we calculated the sample mean from the data and notice that these means 10 to common normal distribution as per central limit theorem regardless of the original population distribution provided that the sample size is sufficiently large. using this principle we can calculate the confidence intervals for the model parameters.

also we learnt that with larger sample sizes standard error of sampling distribution decreases and uncertainty also decreases which leads to improving the precision of estimates. you also plotted the histogram for the errors and do the best fit line using linear regression.",-0.05234952,-0.025041973,-0.011824166,0.0956803,0.0143347485,0.03275506,-0.037709333,0.12757348,0.056615178,0.060867473,0.012537316,-0.015467475,0.055327434,-0.047986567,-0.009957771,-0.0511031,0.03159044,-0.029759727,-0.067478396,-0.057325426,0.08475964,0.005187608,-0.015096937,0.0048241294,0.038938496,-0.086441346,-0.045743205,-0.046238393,-0.029632049,0.04179026,0.04282957,0.020682007,0.07769429,0.0151546905,-0.07067414,-0.07937746,0.045272868,0.03262784,0.07414144,0.0065346863,-0.02783586,-0.0014397833,0.07029895,0.047369443,0.022014521,0.0012575433,0.0009261493,-0.012712331,-0.063235596,0.11132501,-0.07374885,-0.0146216955,0.0035432042,-0.041133545,0.019762153,-0.0472928,-0.05243566,-0.054680448,0.09758994,0.030517312,0.0024360148,-0.042783406,-0.0505514,0.049814913,0.013088797,6.705696e-05,-0.046934005,-0.015257416,0.011291007,0.030533338,-0.09319827,0.029365277,-0.10085741,0.024339575,-0.011947781,-0.036144577,-0.051453296,0.03854778,-0.032978535,-0.060518965,0.053684175,0.09274996,0.012477815,0.016588785,0.022624226,0.035574093,0.0651659,0.03634698,-0.0039414396,-0.031235522,0.06286409,0.025170626,-0.11844156,0.059268817,0.050008178,0.05474888,-0.033432856,-0.042192217,0.058395073,0.0138936415,0.056591127,0.11360512,0.05718673,-0.021827571,-0.020543043,-0.05238199,0.03669877,-0.014131707,0.05729172,0.017045638,-0.047500696,0.00795896,-0.10098723,0.06885784,0.108311564,-0.06938781,-0.028267663,0.009252179,0.006561634,-0.011353814,0.03943882,0.084736645,0.06268401,0.014273891,0.047048286,0.06149158,-0.118469104,6.54816e-33,-0.019864803,0.023935726,0.007986327,0.08659473,-0.04897089,-0.042568006,-0.07342384,-0.00034540126,0.058335975,0.08044834,-0.0017858318,-0.040979538,0.014988153,-0.011389184,0.05842294,0.11018794,-0.037868496,0.029938431,-0.03144024,0.077200525,0.035947237,-0.070864104,0.070648395,0.02364963,0.021524003,0.05634206,0.032177545,0.10826589,-0.002271353,-0.011329442,0.023589166,0.0110283205,-0.025780197,-0.064444445,-0.013736857,-0.034089986,0.01884867,-0.026273122,-0.025516357,0.06110135,0.017343197,0.05060549,0.0996424,0.06878752,0.009846857,-0.026103586,-0.06521317,-0.029405154,0.044434026,0.042702723,-0.07872041,-0.0024214736,-0.03984625,0.011459676,-0.0023711084,0.11934227,-0.06658371,-0.004043538,-0.07819205,0.041925307,-0.04262858,-0.040423993,-0.0035912422,-0.07007755,0.040790122,0.10464013,-0.0036643601,0.03949955,-0.012068347,-0.0058417716,-0.016839528,-0.09260863,-0.068194725,0.03692002,-0.016494915,-0.07438908,0.018262334,0.003770945,-0.0073815347,-0.050047383,-0.030381791,0.028613226,-0.07101539,-0.06183189,-0.053289343,-0.10348767,0.044030584,0.035036635,0.054668944,-0.077323526,-0.022796733,0.00080435484,-0.060758464,-0.001795246,-0.13248326,-6.802275e-33,-0.0075830817,0.05852838,0.008762179,0.058432095,-0.02387215,-0.02482197,0.062593095,-0.024571074,0.012766191,-0.15098198,-0.055462446,0.028930545,0.04456266,0.07132501,0.032253195,-0.006574204,0.022891462,-0.06172363,-0.053385425,-0.06539209,-0.00942371,-0.010076872,0.04536048,-0.03606226,-0.037614834,0.032757808,-0.078616805,0.05298912,-0.07844378,-0.12993482,0.05358676,-0.021783212,-0.055971716,-0.036534697,-0.023222128,0.028590523,0.010467941,0.037329372,-0.019911746,0.0016414652,0.033800893,0.04437134,-0.036219656,-0.12810743,-0.027513815,0.06516497,0.049804397,-0.012465233,0.012531879,-0.06329185,0.03287233,0.020664744,-0.0061768,-0.0018782206,0.0171396,-0.06012556,-0.06093348,-0.025724284,0.004182413,-0.005772162,-0.039892774,0.024222545,-0.050121337,0.040922757,-0.10230872,0.016353572,-0.059599496,-0.019582998,0.0056531024,0.04624358,-0.07428468,-0.08020828,0.03097343,0.018447082,-0.0678739,-0.06393829,-0.039430767,-0.07784233,-0.035021126,-0.008042001,4.1661756e-06,0.0109370975,0.037355773,-0.023257094,-0.054616462,-0.02545284,0.06810732,0.00036727134,0.00040697368,0.0003772384,-0.08151157,-0.017522462,-0.062211767,0.0015060218,0.01501695,-6.948127e-08,-0.06429045,0.10948529,0.05099597,-0.017288774,0.0115770325,0.016749386,-0.038744777,0.020951102,-0.030074624,-0.0015331805,0.03684139,0.004854984,-0.05232254,0.011390499,0.020387437,0.06445687,0.05509816,0.07222681,-0.006623365,-0.052234653,-0.012394315,0.011602318,-0.04856202,-0.03180142,0.11931819,-0.012930352,-0.028496787,0.11640759,-0.046143018,0.07477169,0.013596143,-0.021405462,0.05470598,-0.06513712,0.063695945,-0.016655896,0.028331222,-0.024889441,0.13424121,0.004867041,0.019274713,0.05263204,-0.06996603,0.024130268,0.08013844,0.026964637,0.03381534,0.08550674,-0.035404954,-0.017388724,0.04485716,-0.04239641,-0.047202695,0.05878682,-0.015634738,-0.02932139,-0.07752502,0.0033311688,0.01728838,-0.011373713,0.02939759,0.04804526,-0.006547936,-0.03068117,0,-23.764315,3.7379432,2
51,"in  today's session, we focused on regression metrics, sampling distributions, and the central limit theorem (clt).we were also introduced to the idea that regression coefficients derived from sample data are estimates of population parameters, emphasizing the importance of evaluating their reliability.to understand this ,we examined the concept of sampling distributions, where multiple representative samples are drawn from a population to calculate sample means. these means tend to form a normal distribution as per the central limit theorem, regardless of the original population distribution, provided the sample size is sufficiently large. this principle allows statisticians to infer population characteristics and calculate confidence intervals for model parameters. we also saw metrics like sse (sum of squared errors), mse (mean squared error), rmse (root mean squared error), and mae (mean absolute error), which are necessary for analysing the performance of linear regression models. these metrics help to explain variations in the data and its accuracy in predicting outcomes.
by reducing uncertainty with larger sample sizes, the standard error of the sampling distribution decreases, improving the precision of estimates. and then we made this on excel sheet and plotted histogram for errors and drew best fit line using linear regression.",-0.066418216,-0.033016555,-0.0013476454,0.054513335,0.053893056,0.025247632,-0.035832766,0.12822141,0.09914198,0.005740778,0.00183782,-0.005312277,0.04901791,-0.044133212,-0.007843339,-0.07727629,0.017913014,-0.0033597273,-0.024426794,-0.029674439,0.09047082,0.052562833,-0.036008716,0.031005245,0.012877469,-0.07833014,-0.07829005,-0.045664154,-0.051958326,0.0494294,0.004496995,0.0015518239,0.040482055,0.035243336,-0.06476785,-0.043987166,0.019116234,0.07434071,0.04530082,0.03180528,-0.0009805636,0.01717451,0.047406916,0.019359846,0.0035297656,-0.010152869,0.0044313516,-0.056961652,-0.017978087,0.124808975,-0.04489301,-0.002087001,-0.0042374474,-0.058810603,0.045375254,-0.07000738,-0.048166357,-0.03968857,0.07642933,0.041587166,0.028635174,-0.055194233,-0.04139326,0.044659227,0.018941132,0.003119964,0.0022431186,0.0007107415,-0.024039237,0.014558749,-0.099347204,0.055895608,-0.15664665,0.042809818,0.009539825,-0.0144319385,-0.03927923,0.027521262,-0.02360136,-0.032114834,-0.017461475,0.09161664,0.043708652,-0.043339867,0.028982766,0.039221942,0.062152516,0.049319167,-0.010691628,-0.02938286,0.016036212,0.042419057,-0.092568606,0.064463794,0.022993455,0.057975896,-0.055493426,-0.08219791,0.061587743,0.043588314,0.048578285,0.10308368,0.058407962,-0.042519607,0.050819945,-0.063244335,0.082960956,-0.049758393,-0.0061170203,0.026692651,-0.042179547,-0.004872105,-0.044497102,0.026449252,0.05190626,-0.055022806,-0.055068117,0.09166134,0.0142050665,0.0063131503,0.036302596,0.09670232,0.040485833,-0.021223698,0.06502397,0.04668684,-0.06346923,4.2720558e-33,0.012633131,-0.0030113633,0.023401897,0.043300875,-0.054693192,-0.021687051,-0.067642964,0.020507509,0.062645175,0.056941185,0.028317451,-0.07476592,-0.019859595,-0.0051601934,0.05360347,0.16411702,-0.02388072,0.07041947,-0.034934327,0.01431252,0.01037218,-0.059140686,0.03004299,0.0028293706,-0.019039864,0.01235327,0.0060434733,0.09898116,-0.024931978,-0.020883728,0.0076043857,0.061199125,0.019039178,-0.071876675,0.00719663,-0.003413884,0.027353808,-0.030548368,-0.026133118,0.08917905,-0.02111753,0.07478194,0.087165356,0.060968135,-0.0001151659,-0.02692818,-0.019661717,-0.033389214,-0.0058825347,-0.021229418,-0.11526528,0.01847232,0.006790336,0.02191037,0.006555113,0.09871502,-0.037052546,0.0066517345,-0.061625622,0.012220114,-0.080338135,-0.031516425,-0.0059350166,-0.050926294,0.10614011,0.06349994,-0.030877417,0.045844227,0.02655433,0.040045384,0.04677573,-0.0995951,-0.10420591,0.028949304,0.006252932,-0.07799722,0.04672016,-0.011569723,-0.029658895,-0.06745918,-0.020800956,-0.019360585,-0.094314374,-0.10349282,0.007934923,-0.06972048,0.04184558,0.00240348,0.007270189,-0.081882514,-0.044006966,-0.003786616,-0.069016986,-0.006486143,-0.1566812,-4.3581365e-33,-0.049947836,0.032161683,0.0064403084,0.07737273,-0.013192642,-0.028084014,-0.0038935388,-0.019024696,-0.0005733629,-0.10573722,-0.09276646,-0.044817384,0.09098683,0.014908428,0.012449213,0.01756415,0.009419061,-0.033177648,-0.071275815,-0.0630197,0.004921703,0.0012843417,0.06428598,0.0034581383,-0.030223904,0.008942072,-0.14445396,0.06653457,-0.039632067,-0.11467608,0.013684572,-0.04169601,-0.077818014,-0.020955866,-0.022968024,-0.030358363,0.014447537,0.088417396,-0.01565353,0.071739964,0.022308344,0.008094979,0.0046093524,-0.08101414,-0.0113339005,0.027828604,0.07301275,-0.058714934,-0.02630794,-0.004233586,-0.0045554354,0.004229449,-0.039055504,0.07159898,-0.016485574,-0.034914214,-0.053181004,-0.0089319,0.021384377,-0.007037974,-0.01692435,0.02465224,-0.061670963,0.027613303,-0.06876408,0.030193267,-0.07888452,0.012365185,-0.0006001341,0.080598325,-0.105013244,-0.057504214,0.039410546,0.0012483707,-0.039604824,-0.016080558,-0.012636372,-0.026826618,-0.0077640456,0.05867984,0.04230142,0.02903354,0.031163963,-0.04566469,-0.00015230385,-0.028792141,0.083987616,-0.007578079,-0.006649685,0.009899493,-0.072810456,0.015232934,-0.060768872,0.021368368,-0.043303907,-5.551028e-08,-0.032266665,0.14523391,0.017516704,0.022881433,-0.007945153,-0.0163908,-0.025893511,-0.012452274,-0.099420406,-0.0066706217,0.029355558,0.0068974243,-0.040919818,0.004365363,0.05498205,0.069625705,0.017841542,0.06620526,-0.0030080797,-0.025669252,-0.037644576,-0.009563391,-0.033699993,-0.014865622,0.07019437,-0.0029649753,0.032990836,0.093064494,0.005304609,0.08644493,0.01650506,7.667427e-05,0.06673584,-0.053039614,0.042108737,-0.006071134,-0.021717945,-0.025997868,0.119921625,0.022021204,0.062858485,0.053330813,-0.043969,0.05714413,0.09522089,-0.02170291,0.07700064,0.10232408,-0.033994164,-0.06235908,0.056598406,-0.07491302,-0.010696986,0.057983913,0.040704027,0.0030348767,-0.025939276,0.00543107,0.0029413707,-0.026961694,0.02488115,0.018022215,0.038812235,-0.014157365,11,-24.255882,3.2229815,2
78,"studied about linear regression in excel using closed form solutions derived in previous class. learnt about sse, mse, rmse, mae. learnt about r_square, adjusted r_square and their significance. learnt about anova. good model is the one which explains variations of data. 
sst = ssr + sse , ssr/sst = r^2 , r^2 is called coefficient of determination = square of the correlation between x and y. 
these all metrics reflects quality of linear regression. by central limit theorem, sample means tend to be normal distributed.the expected value of such a distribution is very close to the population mean.the standard deviation of this distribution is known as the standard error is directly proportional to population's standard deviation. as the sample sizes increase, our analysis becomes more

102,"in today's lecture, there was a discussion about population mean & variance and what is sample mean & variance and also how to evalute or estimate them. after that, we learned about central limit theorem with an example of estimation of working hours of a manager. for less sample size (typically less than thirty), we came to learn that how can we use t-distribution to analyze such data. there was also a discussion on z-distribution, p-value, confidence interval and multiple linear regression.

107,"in the previous class, i learned that we rarely have access to an entire populationâ€™s data; instead, we work with a sample, known as a dataset. when training a model, we donâ€™t use the entire sample but randomly allocate about 80% of the data for training, while the remaining 20% is set aside for testing and comparing different models.

in general linear regression, we can have multiple features as well as multiple outputs, which can be expressed in matrix form.

to assess the variance captured per independent variable (degree of freedom), we adjust for the sample mean. since knowing the sample mean reduces the number of independent data points by one, the degree of freedom decreases. the sample mean is used in both ssr (sum of squares for regression) and sst (total sum of squares).

113,"when we have only sample of population (say 30 observations), how do we estimate population statistics like mean ? the idea is to assume that sample mean is close to population mean. we know that sampling distribution of the mean is normal(mu,sigma), get the sample std deviation and assume it is close to population std dev. 
we want to get the interval within which the population mean likely to lie.
""95% confidence interval"" : if you take 100 samples, the mean of 95 of those samples lie in this interval.
p-value  is area under the curve which lie outside of confidence interval.

169,"today's class start with a question that we have only 1 sample (eg 30 observations) so, how to estimate population mean based only on 1 sample ? is it possible. one interesting thing that when errors become predictive then it is not a regression model. whatever the distribution of sample could be -> when we take their multiple sample then we always get normal distribution. let's suppose we have sample from a population then first step would be calculate the mean and(assume this mean is close to the population mean). if it is close to the population mean then sampling distribution of the mean is close normal distribution with mean and variance. the formula for calculating standard deviation of the sampling distribution of means is standard deviation of the population /root under number of observations in sample. further ahead we have learnt about the confidence interval which is basically the area under curve. for 95% confidence, the area under curve is 0.95 and for the observations that doesn't lie in this region is 0.025 each of side. one more important thing what we learnt that if number of observations is less than 30 then we do not get normal distribution and we use t distribution which is basically a continuous probability distribution that generalizes the standard normal distribution. the 95% confidence interval practically means that if we take 100 samples the mean of 95 of those samples will lies between that area. in the equation y=b0 + b1x if b1 is statistically equal to zero then we don't get any regression. if p- value < 0.05 then value of b1 is accepted and p-value also helps in the selection of the features. in the last minutes we also talked about the multiple linear regression which is a statistical technique that uses multiple

amount of information captured by the model is how much variation in the data can be explained by it.
sample means tend to a normal distribution by the central limit theorem.
the standard deviation of that distribution is the standard error and it is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of samples, thus more samples is better.",0.031330835,0.024852218,-0.069802634,0.045469694,0.07261014,0.060964867,-0.07857937,0.068969056,0.12313057,0.053404562,0.01235278,0.110167705,-0.0067302277,0.003793621,-0.00014829542,-0.026351398,0.078367524,-0.029133894,-0.035793714,-0.020807242,0.121605314,-0.046779018,-0.04010176,0.008419497,0.08050254,0.02900425,-0.05619314,-0.02016589,0.018787902,-0.009499811,0.045403216,0.04169307,0.046266433,0.025862714,-0.08164036,-0.057701495,-0.03878172,0.07276856,0.05496575,0.034448672,0.043506645,0.04461258,0.043986075,0.04447431,0.022601333,0.033562914,0.01858856,-0.035546247,-0.0008472553,0.074966036,-0.049477473,-0.03388648,-0.023270834,-0.08432512,0.07066185,-0.06531246,-0.107344955,0.017558679,0.023952529,0.041242976,0.045369577,-0.047706883,-0.009913661,0.05427915,-0.035136793,-0.04914595,-0.05307494,-0.040705416,-0.0040346715,-0.0231717,-0.104998775,0.11240772,-0.034294955,-0.040664967,0.030901799,-0.06278805,-0.058655363,-0.041496973,-0.031808812,0.054898534,0.051331002,0.081824996,-0.011947351,0.014693486,-0.011244413,0.025596077,0.086323395,-0.05142305,-0.053016372,-0.014467566,0.0610717,0.0043576867,-0.047028366,0.07518419,-0.09004829,0.009269169,0.028666258,0.02877775,0.041112565,-0.032536916,0.04971135,0.060250785,0.03735098,0.06546727,-0.03364824,-0.07312607,0.059593894,-0.058856435,0.0516227,0.01638826,-0.010846002,0.019625898,-0.06665995,0.024088178,0.049509183,-0.03835331,-0.027380828,-0.007746814,-0.055925068,0.0075288718,0.013197229,0.0020569393,-0.018252322,-0.028890435,-0.045656055,0.040731,-0.06350385,2.563536e-33,-0.052197285,0.038541306,-0.002343416,0.05524224,-0.03766996,-0.046756346,-0.022785118,-0.011038454,0.09216923,0.06987294,0.018720986,-0.062059633,-0.0023813103,0.11360945,-0.0039339834,0.09151187,-0.02657312,0.05496474,-0.0051361816,0.033111136,0.003042502,-0.021609204,0.058040544,0.028130298,0.005636758,-0.012744486,0.064768456,0.06646337,-0.018033879,-0.031518515,0.019353628,0.029113017,0.0066034105,-0.035427537,0.044581458,-0.02613188,0.07082018,-0.03255913,0.030989358,-0.008568985,0.06748959,0.038703818,0.08102821,0.028697064,0.04204986,-0.006071532,0.012466315,0.0021537174,0.049767397,0.0390648,-0.09943056,-0.017918073,0.009653064,0.051193397,0.07232477,0.065637395,-0.060644843,-0.008681234,-0.05930384,0.06365874,-0.11916785,-0.020122621,0.048828278,-0.032276478,0.07565795,0.06963061,0.012332322,0.002902119,0.062716894,0.06877902,0.0047678906,-0.054329272,-0.08338098,0.0030823308,0.042134464,-0.030077836,0.005263176,-0.023063032,0.0498245,-0.052658495,-0.07918031,-0.0077493065,-0.08314062,-0.070261866,-0.08829709,-0.049496934,0.02041046,-0.08985145,0.040093508,-0.038703993,0.00049414457,0.023702357,-0.09509445,0.015960682,-0.03096083,-3.3595103e-33,0.025452474,0.046438687,-0.09258894,0.059069566,-0.0130623225,-0.02003489,-0.0035382835,-0.088998,0.021408675,-0.0010051997,-0.0108875865,-0.022225495,-0.018954135,0.08339062,0.117638744,0.05003099,0.008570011,-0.02562757,-0.099188805,-0.09605332,-0.053082384,-0.015534962,0.063675776,-0.052440386,-0.007337397,-0.0033318594,-0.098330386,0.025728324,0.0098689925,-0.052285444,-0.029758582,0.036549006,-0.024549244,-0.013406102,-0.078935124,0.08777836,0.021327913,0.014239974,-0.0065057008,0.0027365312,0.018917076,0.062351573,0.020057825,-0.10811451,-0.015800009,-0.0027397072,0.03696347,-0.07010119,0.06860215,-0.0060902783,-0.018209303,0.02874128,0.006831236,0.048742406,-0.0013155399,-0.044122234,-0.118031785,0.041379593,0.017343719,0.020367647,0.025455365,0.020309696,-0.12418215,0.035076946,-0.08471575,0.013980187,-0.025102003,-0.034216844,0.012936696,0.043405972,-0.07281786,-0.057488006,0.039468065,0.0072583538,-0.09152046,-0.051219005,-0.07259651,-0.08208251,-0.08410688,0.049767476,0.04507937,-0.014152744,0.026316423,-0.037883416,-0.035310075,-0.011901994,-0.0040055355,0.011055272,-0.048717268,0.025873559,0.00917204,-0.011296964,-0.0753879,0.046827342,0.034023456,-4.533079e-08,-0.068500504,0.0061043324,0.062213577,-0.07444487,0.0018282965,0.0064781774,-0.022727404,0.04440814,-0.04032393,0.050758865,-0.0018343435,-0.0317683,-0.08057382,0.013450809,0.050690353,0.06588539,-0.0051701735,-0.016749661,0.06478293,0.025477052,-0.033327073,-0.06179783,-0.09844314,-0.033617157,0.12531345,-0.027181419,0.03958011,0.1105627,-0.051720712,0.02390922,0.029959608,0.034683913,0.0714131,-0.03821898,0.034357265,0.0027744297,0.024757195,-0.05212313,0.026027745,-0.051049028,-0.058916744,0.04727042,-0.029223712,0.00548127,0.01733092,0.03984452,0.07722114,-0.020444207,-0.054834917,-0.123399645,0.04104914,-0.06784616,0.0019206471,0.0083763115,-0.0228282,0.03467429,-0.09749621,0.05838832,-0.014056166,-0.03660582,0.006060329,0.10095685,0.026480103,-0.06783792,10,-22.121998,6.023671,2
184,"in today's class will learn how to calculate population mean from sample mean while considering multiple samples and single sample, then we learnt about confidence intervals for estimating a particular population mean and know how to calculate the probability of a particular value of population mean to lie in a certain interval with a particular probability. 

standard error of the mean is given by 
î¼= ïƒ/âˆšn

the means of multiple samples form a normal distribution and their mean is the estimated mean of population.
the probability is calculated in terms of p value.

we also calculated the value of beta 0 and beta 1 for a linear regression model. 

in last we learnt about anova table, which is used to determine if there are statistically significant differences between the means of three or more samples. 
in next lecture multiple regression model will be covered.",0.018405475,0.014816482,-0.036198635,0.023575403,-0.01976219,0.016603237,-0.008195154,0.12540047,0.0872537,0.049459632,0.051401958,-0.018735163,0.027953204,-0.09929217,-0.022067273,-0.05171393,-0.050143454,-0.013423123,-0.021426806,-0.02751705,0.051536623,0.004695701,0.10962401,0.019314239,-0.02601065,-0.037537873,-0.08399666,0.01453551,0.05166909,0.05809416,-0.011353486,0.023186997,0.078134626,0.047434,-0.08603933,-0.083426565,-0.058019146,0.011843133,-0.009591528,0.060580727,-0.0071216803,-0.010193902,0.03821743,0.02239412,0.046807192,-0.03239897,-0.07514718,-0.017095739,0.035224374,0.018045824,-0.008891979,0.0012270868,-0.047453426,-0.047104094,-0.06301235,-0.09370739,-0.048365604,-0.050174497,0.038543083,0.050701566,0.034544762,-0.028178908,0.004688064,0.048825175,0.056916494,0.05006299,-0.07943164,-0.018070323,0.011545493,0.0016365801,-0.10467843,-0.0076774596,-0.08165026,-0.02478176,-0.002536697,-0.060642213,-0.0049574133,0.05288107,-0.052491575,0.014293028,0.04034879,-0.0014059409,-0.009121872,-0.035392597,0.040373493,0.00849657,0.019506134,0.0494308,-0.02612843,-0.019390222,0.0037077235,0.044283994,-0.08137509,0.07899566,-0.020790856,0.051732253,-0.050668813,-0.07437699,0.11491214,0.040178888,0.02460222,0.015835708,0.09301473,-0.032164987,-0.058008913,0.0012344929,0.025430238,-0.038266797,0.0077437772,0.009974763,-0.10085454,-0.043821845,-0.034885943,0.067469746,0.025151713,-0.06357619,-0.014041027,0.047867868,0.058256954,0.019396467,0.04328408,-0.006640347,0.05620416,-0.039917342,-0.022217704,-0.014325276,-0.09601966,5.6255295e-33,-0.006908917,-0.06390213,0.0039440035,0.10313252,0.014659751,0.050434526,-0.029498678,0.00057993346,0.0030961388,0.0008892465,0.07120952,-0.07702748,0.020248694,-0.019300044,0.032311987,0.087523244,-0.009032738,-0.0069572837,0.0015811722,0.06501034,0.029016616,-0.0668832,0.02245145,0.05822057,0.041181345,0.09712563,-0.015756598,0.07092022,-0.018267255,-0.018627679,0.07193503,0.053757332,-0.12696455,-0.052828185,-0.008422356,0.040634308,0.040684547,0.01088909,-0.021761073,0.06433873,-0.014306938,0.031757686,0.06376516,-0.012397382,0.065238476,0.003575664,-0.03156713,0.02768672,-0.021656005,0.0044043134,-0.08082336,-0.003987219,-0.029179957,0.03173698,-0.007798025,0.09392584,-0.1299292,0.0550816,-0.04831498,-0.002676784,-0.02068184,-0.0011180954,0.0028796277,-0.021758152,0.041843284,0.1284622,-0.0714496,0.03858978,0.06935472,0.030609837,0.035900854,-0.03423556,-0.07097551,0.010674736,-0.082956165,0.014055345,0.009462984,-0.0020982907,0.05651521,-0.069275714,0.017898118,-0.0016358237,-0.11273234,-0.063260734,0.003139109,0.045387026,0.040950276,-0.029096719,0.05824735,-0.068698354,0.051913608,-0.017594498,-0.06510569,-0.039636794,-0.029955091,-7.270984e-33,0.006800901,0.069478184,-0.01882854,0.019780211,0.027184471,-0.013677316,0.0771609,-0.06543104,0.039256837,-0.03727564,-0.10610281,0.0010636966,0.0409607,-0.052732203,0.03627541,0.02052371,0.09084759,-0.069413185,-0.071521565,-0.018956752,-0.012582055,-9.809901e-05,0.0047851847,-0.033747785,-0.114387415,0.0024662658,-0.081529245,-0.00915204,-0.08682549,-0.11400195,0.014949684,-0.110291384,0.0014630549,-0.022112377,-0.035797562,-0.03330636,0.013727825,0.061841857,0.026993414,0.01583622,0.009691193,0.03362211,0.04073656,-0.073869996,0.045951948,0.11633629,0.051316388,-0.010183855,-0.011297861,-0.07146022,0.0070447586,-0.05563925,-0.024954807,-0.0046686013,0.00735845,-0.018048614,-0.017201845,-0.033570062,-0.0047379313,0.023231879,-0.017565558,0.0045780414,-0.06430964,0.10617706,-0.09299525,0.0010010237,-0.051327888,-0.026757257,0.016685944,0.030404424,-0.037643135,-0.01476169,0.031467393,-0.034847163,-0.04100126,-0.021564625,-0.097109064,-0.06726746,-0.010161742,-0.0070171515,-0.06740523,-0.035618987,-0.014912314,-0.076169536,0.0007538847,-0.12510853,0.10952596,0.04136776,-0.011729516,-0.031376056,-0.060892068,0.0681811,-0.07323186,-0.065017596,0.016907552,-5.5796608e-08,0.09329503,0.03295382,0.046324626,-0.007597985,0.04948619,0.04458506,-0.036846254,0.012851672,-0.014921204,-0.054978717,0.004843919,-0.01381349,0.0015271087,0.0029300163,0.03753527,0.104341514,0.02810911,0.07414873,-0.011334833,-0.028690765,-0.0226672,-0.028288264,-0.0034749685,-0.0014976419,0.06971107,0.0636025,-0.022013709,0.05820899,-0.04120978,0.05503674,-0.014901071,-0.010327089,0.11613005,-0.053936806,0.13200589,-0.0073346207,0.051644605,-0.03291955,0.15033263,-0.05451823,-0.007095949,-0.055063553,0.04421643,0.082279354,0.071521156,0.007368218,0.046071585,0.011309887,-0.0011589065,-0.035116095,0.034363363,-0.018366244,-0.11091355,0.053394068,-0.043331586,0.06552214,0.002389461,0.012713174,0.020575503,-0.08858583,0.020713504,0.00054168346,-0.020299882,-0.058019366,11,-25.287735,0.036238726,2
218,"we continued in this lecture defining the various result tools. like p-value, t-stats, upper and lower confidence interval. first we took a small sample and tried to find the confidence whether it is taken from the population or not? with the help of mean.
since we dont know the population standard deviation we take that of the sample to calculate the standard error and plot the normal distribution. in our todays class we just try to focus on to how much extent the sample can represent the population or whether the correct sample is taken with how much probability. we defined various steps to do that. as i discussed above. also if the number of observation is less than 30 we use t-distribtion. it is more wider and shorter as compared to a normal distribution. 95% confidence interval. what does that mean? if you take 100 samples the mean of 95 of those samples would lie between the range values defined at those confidence interval. t-stat=(x-u)/std dev.

what is p-value? it tells you how likely beta1 =0 or what is the chance the data does not have a regression model. because in excel if the p-value is very low that means mean of the data is statistically greatly different than 0.(for slr it is beta1). if it is >=0.05 then we can not say 95% confidently that it follows regression.

in mlr p-value helps you in feature selection.at last we touched upon anova it is used to compare statistical equivalence of ""multiple averages simultaneouly"". anova gives you the f-statistics= msr/mse. so if f-stat is larger that means variance is better explained by the regression.",-0.023077201,0.10908968,-0.0014311695,0.003621447,-0.008434479,-0.017005008,-0.03564209,0.1806889,0.096452996,0.06111122,0.028212203,-0.035764903,0.052474663,-0.08893382,0.022039901,-0.11120972,0.07787168,-0.09842591,0.011182544,-0.0113913175,0.024662705,0.029139768,0.031650085,-0.003831763,0.013903038,0.0017415883,-0.092104375,-0.04131289,0.06825244,0.07867205,-0.035810545,0.048916522,0.05999397,0.008589737,-0.027821245,-0.05534359,-0.060178623,0.051484086,0.024303837,0.008042803,0.0316435,-0.0649405,0.007083444,0.05518162,-0.033585478,-0.00026852154,-0.02389072,-1.9406477e-06,-0.056593608,0.028259194,-0.03974619,0.11608341,-0.06254295,-0.01465562,-0.022841243,-0.0038000206,-0.015095764,-0.08892193,0.006919484,0.014845799,0.004161602,-0.014225338,-0.0013467364,0.019452594,0.056246523,-0.030047521,-0.02529089,-0.03491221,0.06283061,-0.0794888,-0.11577708,0.034848675,-0.06691664,0.062960625,-0.06536457,-0.071852624,-0.04723144,0.00056939723,-0.056026265,0.012339478,0.09394914,0.05065143,-0.036975272,0.005289771,0.026292901,0.0051670866,0.049025033,0.113182195,-0.02389249,0.0364734,0.07080127,0.025988447,-0.12336864,0.08279271,0.035490714,0.017905548,-0.064843535,-0.023704952,0.067959845,0.0054550124,-0.0066994135,0.059413332,0.061120212,-0.07534809,-0.10344177,-0.04228893,0.014073976,-0.06264771,0.03239254,0.02886945,-0.054154564,-0.04393182,-0.013878986,-0.00952758,0.10023541,-0.07024101,-0.100599386,0.05147262,-0.00751461,-0.06345961,0.028716436,0.04526432,-0.009720039,0.05268972,0.06652215,0.048281357,-0.039617173,3.6704664e-33,0.027889844,-0.030667625,-0.03700586,0.1104748,-0.03205168,0.06633315,-0.07697919,-0.028635483,-0.004999854,0.09471437,0.0061587235,-0.087136514,0.015458038,0.011566411,0.031923976,0.09882498,-0.0045399847,0.025771046,-0.043008767,0.029751683,0.022173572,-0.014666445,0.04025804,0.042998876,0.043565646,0.060075037,-0.07597102,0.058958974,-0.013943517,-0.044587314,-0.043984577,0.0048706033,-0.022374269,-0.078086816,0.0037017248,-0.004940367,0.044744216,0.009369863,-0.052626994,0.0064699184,-0.014253572,0.03746113,0.04099824,0.06956193,0.0516062,-0.024031166,0.018337538,-0.025805982,-0.031448115,0.026742795,-0.029294241,-0.008521296,-0.008648134,0.0055324426,-0.032706458,0.069681264,-0.01881295,-0.0029543461,-0.04860109,0.08165092,0.022419572,-0.021911444,-0.04175364,-0.042131517,0.035801556,0.11769896,-0.04595109,0.034020126,0.027005073,0.08767137,-0.008371784,-0.06401988,-0.06640058,-0.017314706,0.025833895,0.020100662,0.061530758,0.008938408,0.052540254,-0.06880609,-0.04314352,-0.017653987,-0.06556309,-0.030421639,0.019386817,-0.022213984,0.021658983,0.059113286,0.047552913,-0.103833534,-0.013524449,-0.017338028,-0.1509239,0.047413662,-0.063585296,-4.8882808e-33,-0.012827886,0.069417804,-0.02524234,0.040899076,-0.03479243,-0.0039387075,0.050104905,-0.080490656,0.053070854,-0.07484923,-0.034804434,-0.06061933,0.013054739,-0.06218841,0.007937461,-0.015402017,0.037549064,-0.05646121,-0.09343116,-0.02269588,0.009166134,0.011854487,-0.038822774,-0.057742074,-0.040539503,0.046049014,-0.045494616,-0.011944077,-0.018155439,-0.12397804,-0.021090256,-0.07218024,0.03210473,0.0039755576,-0.03427511,0.03845338,0.002322218,0.02652547,0.051463455,-6.4621768e-06,0.038515054,0.020365536,0.020446824,-0.07384188,-0.05281405,0.12902272,0.0061193234,-0.076713175,0.03999509,-0.03311359,0.078403085,0.039714634,0.0071749953,0.03523746,-0.014152386,-0.01207958,-0.08486747,-0.03519609,-0.039360136,0.0040353066,0.055948067,0.01643969,-0.07716899,0.07864199,-0.092328526,0.042634305,-0.025945567,0.018471688,0.0026500246,0.021912863,-0.081211135,0.008896243,0.07494504,-0.085306,-0.0049586524,-0.034466617,-0.04112597,-0.017517157,0.054711953,0.046661813,-0.053834647,-0.009692768,-0.010244867,-0.043696206,-0.018693686,-0.029237004,0.027322868,-0.027822584,0.036452983,0.05018502,-0.021353494,0.019325418,-0.027660295,0.016653992,0.07270165,-6.298854e-08,-0.03748321,-0.02900423,0.018563684,0.0077789905,0.07839646,0.08730152,-0.024315258,-0.0063455408,-0.024583772,-0.03264747,0.019859193,-0.09710936,-0.09686158,-0.035060626,0.08570111,0.048019253,-0.02846785,-0.0019356479,0.017302483,-0.07997783,-0.012804721,-0.05222747,-0.027919618,-0.01247814,0.04120824,0.047290333,-0.0023495057,0.03664719,-0.015960947,-0.026862217,0.028992847,-0.04717693,0.032201756,0.0084088,0.10737107,-0.0061175516,-0.0013396863,-0.0060833874,0.08577951,0.020098709,-0.064402126,0.033971865,-0.024385298,0.031508297,0.003821084,0.004849985,0.029389601,0.07861696,-0.0020764386,-0.032617945,0.08124507,0.038216274,-0.076381765,0.010753987,-0.06943134,0.11206963,0.04058798,0.004014738,-0.10028741,-0.067909576,0.04632982,0.006762077,0.014675522,-0.06303525,11,-28.344017,0.74859375,2
222,"we learned about the metrics used to check how good a linear regression model is, like sse,râ²,etc. 
we also have a hands on excel .
the data we use is just a sample , so the values we calculate for the model, like a and b, are only guesses about the real values for the entire population.
goal  is to create a model that works well for data outside the sample.
idea of sampling distributions and confidence intervals. if we take many small samples from the population and find their means, those means would form a normal distribution, even if the population data isnâ€™t normally distributed. this is called the central limit theorem (clt). the bigger samples give more accurate results, while smaller samples create more uncertainty.

252,"when working with data...we almost never have access to the entire populationâ€”just a sample, which we call a dataset, but when training a model, we donâ€™t use the whole dataset....instead, we randomly split it...about 80% for training and 20% for testing.....the test set helps us compare different models and see how well they perform on new data.

multiple r (the square root of r^2) tells us how strongly the independent and dependent variables are related.....in linear regression, we can have multiple input variables (features) and even multiple outputs, which means we often solve the problem using matrices.

when analyzing variance, we want to know how much each independent variable contributes. the concept of degrees of freedom comes into play hereâ€”since we use the sample mean, we effectively lose one degree of freedom. because both ssr (sum of squares for regression) and sst (total sum of squares) involve the mean, we adjust for this in the formula for adjusted râ²:

adjusted r^2 = 1 - ((ssr/(n-k-1))/(sst/(n-1)))

quantile-quantile (qq) plot tells us how close distribution is to normal distribution, ideal plot is y=x.

260,"1. major focus of todayâ€™s lecture was on sampling distribution, how from a sample of population, one can estimate sampling distribution.
2. the mean of distribution being the expected value of the sample mean and the variance of distribution being sigma/sqrt(n) 
3. once estimated one can then analyse the data and can find the confidence interval which is the percentage of area i.e. 95% interval holds area of 0.95
4. when number of observations is less than 30, t distribution holds with its own defined formula and t statistics is applied
5. then we move to concept of p value, that is the possibility that a sample is being selected from a different distribution altogether
6. we then analysed the chances where linear regression is not possible that is when beta 1 is statistically 0
7. same for multiple linear regression, any one is non zero simultaneously.",-0.04753753,-0.01191339,0.014128736,0.029301189,0.071948715,0.037061863,0.03707184,0.113441005,0.10846224,0.07508642,0.06263722,0.031155536,-0.006134504,-0.060293674,-0.0020644574,-0.07140168,0.017789591,-0.09070392,-0.020644868,0.0015742488,0.036620323,-0.037882805,0.038548566,0.0059708566,0.05071932,-0.011375712,-0.07198074,-0.07654454,0.00641905,0.030551609,-0.022733252,0.07227575,-0.020875951,0.030253725,0.00031764223,-0.10121213,-0.08459901,0.05230211,0.07401058,0.062204238,0.0038489352,-0.0742297,-0.007745961,0.0068286015,0.043489847,-0.014205806,-0.0098295985,0.005880113,0.010093151,0.025069106,-0.04664774,0.0009851103,0.00031235232,-0.0008823555,-0.04692634,-0.11446172,0.013957923,-0.02457581,0.077502444,0.07579627,0.025903419,0.024621231,0.0068866983,0.10177109,0.03352517,0.045795448,-0.07785723,0.00033880127,-0.032351654,-0.031440634,-0.09315412,0.07336723,-0.10259972,-0.024923032,0.004767667,-0.07901829,0.00057595526,-0.01396032,-0.020500235,0.045025017,0.10236608,0.0830926,-0.033680618,-0.07352997,0.006066956,0.022157151,-0.0059604878,0.095252216,0.022021135,-0.010327444,-0.021098288,0.01786435,-0.1001295,0.088838875,-0.01419061,0.024463713,-0.03568386,-0.05129267,0.091922104,0.013671986,-0.027518269,0.032020144,0.06676804,0.013888366,-0.0745611,-0.01890621,0.013839256,-0.061902996,0.015468656,0.029219884,-0.1046307,-0.012430435,0.044526186,0.03206666,0.012354689,-0.096398674,-0.010475688,0.06480035,-0.024316113,-0.021282632,0.034277845,0.049112543,0.063432224,0.04413079,-0.016329465,0.011524432,-0.044350464,9.145307e-33,0.01314834,-0.07372561,-0.0015882308,0.050849725,0.025672218,0.030640136,-0.03582525,-0.014866842,0.07184877,0.035528593,0.036442086,-0.11887541,0.047132626,-0.015908554,0.030937929,0.11661537,0.009837739,0.078666374,0.03821677,0.032665867,-0.04319379,-0.031896982,-0.035035178,-0.0046826433,-0.00242156,0.036215417,-0.050725196,0.074008435,-0.02389423,-0.001441749,-0.062578626,0.07592229,-0.077996284,-0.08522291,0.013294139,-0.0018122123,0.027124086,0.020485366,-0.07482907,0.03725735,-0.01575305,0.04297256,0.06553935,-0.0041428846,0.028875936,-0.032559454,0.039803915,-0.027218409,0.02984709,-0.05921144,-0.028875463,0.012107081,-0.046308413,0.02795374,0.014058869,0.0983008,-0.15413506,-0.0278282,-0.0057698223,0.07511516,-0.004567582,-0.049471885,-0.07040977,-0.121196516,0.101746105,0.070923656,0.0142322825,-0.020389978,0.014450042,0.052656777,0.058129195,-0.065020435,-0.104120225,-0.006018268,-0.025509212,0.014034576,-0.006555792,0.04370462,0.034899462,-0.04181704,-0.02182522,-0.101464815,-0.04184441,-0.030327337,0.023612887,-0.0010508321,0.069723256,-0.011895424,0.017954556,-0.083789654,0.0044583697,-0.07514983,-0.09377996,0.0036349732,0.013448941,-9.7722556e-33,-0.031286154,0.074817196,0.029116208,0.006081463,-0.029145017,-0.0385179,0.020390596,-0.051757313,0.013364381,-0.024944516,-0.13333759,-0.045882814,0.022258135,-0.04774721,-0.0029015236,-0.011533129,0.05355037,0.016874906,-0.066814445,0.005608136,0.013177721,-0.0033568076,-0.016083539,0.013026041,-0.08561219,0.06195366,-0.1259074,0.08095616,-0.024949174,-0.07027022,0.0073512215,-0.04748732,-0.0038867441,-0.030100651,-0.057293363,0.045034274,-0.054304864,0.08359288,0.100349225,0.055533484,0.07558276,-0.026013253,0.03752895,-0.16844542,-0.032827534,0.061050706,0.09676224,-0.025298186,0.03285119,-0.091763265,0.018523008,0.04486572,-0.013187735,0.096417904,-0.018541485,-0.016080497,-0.041521944,-0.0014015392,0.063278474,-0.02965187,0.06676746,0.046747383,-0.059333608,0.051682353,-0.038707674,-0.0036229251,-0.09447914,0.01512608,-0.0046446198,0.04446693,-0.07539377,-0.037567463,0.06539994,-0.04057948,-0.018995183,-0.022783905,-0.053313263,-0.024635091,0.01856503,0.05213141,-0.029901419,0.01907777,-0.0412577,-0.052130017,-0.0250111,-0.04541665,0.10109455,-0.033900015,0.07386129,-0.077851444,-0.008037631,0.04479115,-0.031876925,0.009605287,0.09424581,-5.8871283e-08,0.032525424,0.011388066,0.033387903,-0.008725416,0.026070457,0.06611861,0.0054120636,-0.0037688394,-0.05824263,-0.023319634,-0.0022147433,-0.03616021,-0.03601234,0.007087154,-0.012009417,0.024920164,-0.07311019,0.040001873,0.0171455,-0.06688711,0.030791849,-0.021653455,-0.0018373196,-0.07245324,0.027477298,0.025737107,0.04467963,0.0071347435,-0.023470106,0.03138831,-0.012942142,0.0018817084,-0.025646118,-0.03901259,0.056237597,0.0010739338,0.0016102645,-0.055866826,0.06579769,-0.024624739,-0.011731273,0.01782861,-0.035245452,0.041203067,0.06893857,-0.012127511,0.0400856,0.038084764,-0.0038388663,-0.09113069,0.06781744,-0.0138994,-0.07135967,0.06953114,0.010229386,0.053720932,-0.05403339,0.01369057,-0.040608257,-0.06076376,0.06990532,-0.029917503,-0.009747725,-0.048405062,11,-24.399252,-1.8053777,2
267,"in todayâ€™s class, we explored several important statistical concepts. we started by learning how to estimate the population mean using sample means, both when dealing with a single sample and multiple samples. we then moved on to confidence intervals, which are used to estimate a population mean within a specific range and determine the probability that a particular value of the population mean lies within that interval.
we also discussed the standard error of the mean, which measures the variability of sample means and is calculated as:
standardâ errorâ (se)=s/âˆšn
here, s is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size. we observed that when we take multiple samples, the means of these samples form a normal distribution, with their mean serving as the best estimate for the population mean. probabilities in these contexts are often expressed in terms of the p-value, which indicates the likelihood of observing a result as extreme as the one we obtained, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
then we studied the anova (analysis of variance) table, which is used to assess whether there are statistically significant differences among the means of three or more groups. this is a key tool for comparing group means in experimental data.

in the next lecture, weâ€™ll delve into multiple regression models, where weâ€™ll learn how to handle situations involving more than one independent variable.",-0.00470261,0.060643643,-0.007103128,0.041086417,-0.031753886,0.018834773,-0.010690754,0.1102109,0.09483806,0.031091338,0.020951524,-0.042927623,0.027650494,-0.10017221,-0.005884562,-0.0953002,0.01589459,0.055606153,-0.05741076,0.03611839,0.06495891,-0.006517551,0.124145396,0.053135347,-0.030566555,-0.008239306,-0.06272789,-0.0014279066,0.041303452,0.030557431,0.00245331,0.06331547,0.09326477,0.03386695,-0.03425633,-0.023936406,-0.051071458,0.07733575,0.03182914,0.064881265,-0.012379166,0.024814852,0.04472196,-0.0047326297,-0.05759573,-0.012955287,-0.027328407,-0.031433355,-0.044306245,0.06256265,0.005180361,0.050683487,-0.05356609,-0.02556865,-0.059872586,-0.03024759,-0.035948683,-0.07456047,0.049451996,0.027844617,0.046588928,-0.06138819,0.014510422,0.03863998,0.06627032,-0.023716308,0.008456139,-0.026152749,0.029350262,0.003988855,-0.095764026,0.02865904,-0.11270795,0.06029106,-0.008510123,-0.021655666,-0.029093312,0.006584949,-0.037585385,-0.044632465,0.07923094,-0.019096054,-0.028778806,0.00809514,0.092768006,-0.008067852,0.03812025,0.052363563,-0.024313018,0.032411773,-0.033712182,0.040858615,-0.043495882,0.088552095,0.045639373,0.06264003,-0.04692083,-0.06345206,0.12569313,0.04484124,0.08152973,0.066081904,0.0775376,-0.041225318,-0.022659406,-0.057620477,-0.01735076,-0.113764726,0.025956664,-0.010366592,-0.08743363,-0.026919076,-0.08257308,0.0033962475,0.027884606,-0.09598582,-0.02508762,0.11216672,0.064934716,0.018062884,0.05884042,0.01663887,0.050057262,-0.044989597,0.084646985,0.013015643,-0.062352866,3.9875053e-33,0.022651464,-0.051133096,-0.007862784,0.121241584,0.0072748763,0.008059081,-0.046096493,-0.017047489,-0.020134361,0.0136617245,0.04063483,-0.030054243,0.0315268,-0.02345349,0.019169696,0.10814523,-0.04878911,-0.015372593,-0.043459173,-0.026207717,0.024438152,-0.05254768,0.05883068,0.051299218,3.0508676e-05,-0.00063703704,-0.03807178,0.047778495,0.0015287548,-0.035987858,0.0068195784,0.002136201,-0.071999155,-0.031157337,-0.007894341,-0.003392422,0.09015451,-0.010687881,-0.006711633,0.05559571,-0.046864912,0.04780427,0.07494807,-0.0020147653,0.03972936,-0.017947592,-0.051794413,0.033906963,-0.019982746,-0.029493872,-0.09851733,-0.013878476,0.07412754,0.025752088,-0.0015544135,0.034732074,-0.0641435,0.030263986,-0.06222673,-0.021581784,0.0072291275,0.005255946,-0.021587556,0.050483633,0.059006713,0.11963451,-0.034193724,0.093512684,0.013491606,0.01206028,0.016102226,-0.045971714,-0.085907936,-0.025669357,-0.08284983,0.011704108,0.017916199,0.07183378,0.032746345,-0.0463368,-0.02001456,-0.020579686,-0.08718081,-0.07715408,-0.07843136,0.041325703,0.016595758,-0.057104256,0.05968948,-0.05660249,0.02771466,9.904825e-05,-0.054602426,-0.008710524,-0.051139165,-5.604805e-33,-0.06578183,0.058963116,-0.010580148,0.07671802,0.037185606,-0.0024601321,0.09673272,-0.056210488,-0.02401583,-0.063398406,-0.11807462,-0.006981901,0.07320308,-0.071608104,-0.010904336,0.03477517,0.11183338,-0.00537116,-0.056323133,-0.042242564,0.0038429857,0.043040745,-0.010031384,-0.000432943,-0.028899372,0.0056987545,-0.060367126,-0.036278028,-0.118015125,-0.10948577,0.04248662,-0.07269191,-0.041308895,-0.008561363,-0.018979594,-0.02366664,0.06888817,0.051216226,-0.030666493,0.010934754,-0.012111634,0.0715075,0.09248857,-0.053029254,0.034640864,0.07703578,0.036878336,-0.020717243,-0.043418813,0.002777661,0.013524612,-0.034001093,-0.05959846,0.008526187,0.016317755,-0.0005468841,-0.0028276248,-0.06478857,-0.017085474,0.024899727,-0.014206442,0.00037520076,-0.09066157,0.10460645,-0.096054345,0.0077059753,-0.071625024,-0.08369242,0.008861118,0.031978585,-0.0031826624,-0.04029182,0.0046167383,-0.088385575,-0.04563736,0.01049122,-0.02749205,-0.010815018,-0.027052483,-0.014796524,-0.016364945,-0.06438524,0.014476446,-0.089366026,-0.03136178,-0.060897138,0.054965783,0.035148177,-0.007885081,0.015931312,-0.07630209,0.010089834,-0.0883098,-0.049854714,-0.0011707731,-6.167016e-08,0.062633514,0.028938867,0.0011579071,-0.048730858,0.06853236,0.029817414,-0.07958802,-0.0075110416,-0.00906272,-0.07457132,0.11148792,-0.025643596,-0.04403693,0.011836691,0.07098626,0.08773627,0.0003372803,0.049064215,-0.014712457,-0.019450238,-0.023191473,-0.0077045173,-0.028934415,-0.013309707,0.07801496,0.047980208,-0.013333692,0.08596337,-0.0058940565,-0.027559584,0.025621438,-0.030707182,0.11557584,-0.03893646,0.07517003,0.009735147,0.02709712,-0.009670718,0.09571277,0.023001289,-0.036033984,-0.017748125,-0.01182255,0.068389356,0.012416017,-0.038770966,0.0024773532,0.054248244,-0.024133448,-0.021206338,0.022552682,-0.067253724,-0.037603192,0.056325734,0.0023009398,0.06102599,0.034697544,0.010277764,-0.0059008487,-0.11247067,0.11424518,0.018602928,-0.06467542,-0.02697617,11,-26.057007,0.8443671,2
282,"class started with a recap of previous class. one of the inherent assumption of closed form of linear regression is errors are normally distributed. if that is violated we have to take care of it. whatever be the distribution of sample, when we take multiple samples and calculate the mean of the samples, we will always get normal distribution of means of samples. lets suppose we have only one sample with 30 observations. 
step1: calculate mean of the sample.(here we assume that the calculated mean is close to the population mean.) 
[if we have many sample all these means would form a normal distribution(u,s/root(n)).] step2: get the sample std dev and assume it to be close to samples std deviation 
step3: calculate sigma/root(n), we can describe the normal distribution. 
we want to get interval within which the population mean is likely to lie.
using excel, python and other tools we can create data with a particular distribution.
after this sir went explain statistics and explained estimation of parameter using statistics. then sir explained about the gaussian normal distribution. if the number of observations is less than 30, we wont get a normal distribution. we would get a t- distribution. so generally when the number of observations are less than 30, we must use t distribution. we started with a sample and we are able to say with x% confidence that population mean lies in an interval. 95% confidence interval- ""if you take 100 samples, the mean of 95 of those samples will lie in this interval. t=(x-u)/std.dev
p value: we have a sample and we calculated 95% confidence interval. we get a new set of observations - sample 2 and sample 3. the mean of sample 2 lies in the confidence interval whereas mean of sample 3 does not lie in confidence interval. we can say that sample 2 belongs to the population and sample 3 does not belong to population. 
when a=0 (y=ax+b) becomes zero, we can't use linear regression.  we find the distribution of a. we have a calculated value of a. we find the confidence interval. if zero lies in this confidence interval, we cant have linear regression.  (statistically all values in confidence interval are similar). p value is the area under curve between x=b1 and infinity *2. p value is determined by the position of b1. for the regression to be nice,

292,"we started the lecture with a quick recap of the concepts from previous class- including regression coefficients and discussed about the sampling distribution of mean (histogram plots of the sample). we learnt that whatever be the distribution of the population, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will always be normally distributed. we donâ€™t have the opportunity to take multiple samples. we can practically take a single sample, which can have multiple observations. so, using these â€˜statisticsâ€™ values, we have to estimate the population parameters. so, while taking up a sample, we assume that it is a â€˜goodâ€™ representative of the population.
so, our first step towards estimating the population parameters, is to calculate the mean of sample, by assuming that it is close to population mean.
then we find out the sample standard distribution, assuming that it is close to population standard distribution. so, our ultimate goal is to find out an interval around the calculated value of sample mean, within which we can say with certain confidence level that our population mean would lie. for our sample observations, we make different categories/â€™binsâ€™ in which we divide the data values. then we plot a histogram (frequency distribution graph) for these bins. we observe that as we start decreasing the width of the class, the curve becomes smoother and smoother. this curve has a gaussian normal distribution.
if we divide the frequency values for various bins, by the total frequency, we get the probability that a certain data point will lie within that bin. the area under the curve within that interval, gives us the value of probability. 
so, when we say there is a 95% confidence interval, by it we mean that- if you take 100 samples, then 95 out of these would lie in that interval. also, the area under the curve within this interval would be 0.95. these plots are called â€˜probability density function(pdf)â€™.
if the number of observations is less than 30, then the distribution becomes a â€˜tâ€™ distribution, rather than a normal distribution.
the normal(or t) distribution is centered around the mean, and its tails extend to infinity on both the sides. for an interval, say (a,b), any value within this is â€˜not statistically differentâ€™ from the mean. but any value out of this interval can be said to be â€˜statistically differentâ€™ from the mean values. it may also come from an entirely different population. 
so, if we want to check whether a model is truly a slr model, we can check whether the coefficient of x, i.e. 'a' is statistically different from 0 or not. if it is, then we may conclude that the model is appropriate.
we consider that 0 is the at the centre of the distribution and then define an interval for 95% confidence, we want the value of the regression coefficient to lie outside this, so as to make our regression model valid.
twice the area under the curve from the point, which corresponds to the regression coefficient, to infinity is termed as the â€˜p-valueâ€™. so, for a 95% confidence interval, we want our p-value to be less than 0.05.
we can use this for multiple linear regression as well. those independent variables that have corresponding p-values, greater than 0.05(95% confidence) can be neglected in the regression expression.
lastly, we talked about anova- analysis of variance, which is a tool that tells you what is the statistic probability that at least one of the coefficients in mlr is non zero.

304,"in today's session we went forward with more statistics.
whatever the distribution of the population, the sampling distribution of the mean will always be a normal distribution.

problem: you have only one sample (eg. 30 observations). in real life, many times it is not possible to get multiple samples. we need to estimate the population mean based only on s1.

for this we are assuming that the sample is representative of the population.

step 1: calculate the sample mean. (assume this mean is close to the population mean)
now sampling distribution of the mean => normal(mu, sigma).
s(xbar) = sigma/sqrt(x) = s/sqrt(x)      
{sigma: population standard deviation ; s: sample standard deviation}

step 2: calculate the sample standard deviation and assume it to be close to population standard deviation.

we want to get the interval within which the population mean is likely to lie.

also, if the number of observations is less than 30 then instead of normal the sampling distribution follows t-distribution.

95% confidence interval:
if you take 100 samples, the mean of 95 of those samples will lie between the lower and upper limits of the interval.

then we discussed about t-value = (x - mu)/standard deviation

p-value:
y = b0 + b1*x
if b1 is statistically equal to zero, then we do not have a regression.
if b1 lies in the 95% confidence interval of normal distribution with mean=0 and sigma=same as that of the sampling distribution of b1 then it is statistically equal to zero.

p-value should be less than 0.05.

multiple linear regression:

316,"we studied the following statistical concepts: population and sample means alongside confidence intervals, which led us to understanding the standard error of means, written as ðœ‡ = ðœž/âˆšð‘›. from these, we understood that the normal distribution is applicable wherein the average of multiple sample means is equal to the population mean. in these analysis, the p-value has been a key variable for assessing the value of probabilities and guiding feature selection. we determined the intercept, slope as well as their respective coefficients which explain the relationship between the variablesâ€™ relationship. moreover, the f-statistic which addresses variance that has been accounted for was alongside the anova table â€“ in relation to the significance testing of average group differences. also, the lack of significance stems from the misunderstanding of the basic principles. this therefore bridges the gap between statistical concepts and how to prepare for

325,"today we learned about sample statistics and estimating the sample mean. estimating the sample mean and hypothesis testing are fundamental concepts in statistics, commonly used to draw conclusions about a population based on sample data.

the sample mean is a point estimate of the population mean, calculated by summing the values in a sample and dividing by the number of observations. it is an approximation for the population mean when it is impractical to collect data from every member of the population. the sample mean is unbiased, meaning its expected value equals the population mean. however, variability exists across different samples, and the sample meanâ€™s accuracy increases with larger sample sizes, as stated by the central limit theorem (clt).

hypothesis testing is a method to assess claims or hypotheses about a population parameter, such as the mean. the process starts with the formulation of a null hypothesis (hâ‚€) and an alternative hypothesis (hâ‚). using sample data, a test statistic is calculated, and its significance is determined by a p-value, which indicates the probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis is true. a common threshold is 0.05; if the p-value is smaller than this threshold, the null hypothesis is rejected. hypothesis tests, like t-tests, are widely used to determine if there is enough evidence to support or refute a claim about a population parameter, balancing false positive and false negative errors. 

we also discussed the normal and t-distributions, the latter having more weight in the tails and hence reflecting a higher probability of outliers. t-tests are used for n<30.",0.0029970936,0.05786797,0.00045949986,0.007824697,0.03566567,-0.0014391931,-0.024937006,0.12517093,0.090870336,0.068080604,0.015268142,-0.031568006,0.009558973,-0.076385766,0.016568555,-0.08726075,0.015106108,-0.01854122,0.047064077,-0.0070303776,-0.0020281433,-0.020696389,0.074003726,0.042789545,-0.040638864,-0.003794884,-0.05098617,-0.05921191,0.036903393,0.044752974,-0.028110946,0.08776657,0.10958815,-0.011768795,-0.0050619794,-0.026925357,-0.0048640803,0.05038809,0.0010732432,0.106527984,0.026227914,0.041991815,0.0022873105,-0.024718309,-0.014493024,0.058270108,0.002447753,0.009513369,-0.0920337,0.06973278,-0.009720227,0.0608954,-0.05542359,-0.039552033,8.4016145e-05,-0.08321132,-0.034128048,0.00439543,0.079282284,0.045535218,0.0079561705,-0.07623097,0.017650831,0.028989878,0.10837682,-0.035304967,0.024083659,-0.065598525,0.0474106,-0.059891913,-0.022489006,0.06125545,-0.113187306,0.05531257,0.0021406205,0.022442535,-0.04336617,0.0013464263,0.008682265,-0.010027505,-0.026807481,0.020194398,0.0053963806,-0.045855105,0.064212464,0.012488615,0.09528859,0.036232695,-0.069510564,-0.013893665,0.019017061,-0.009430423,-0.1297533,0.046294384,-0.013634054,0.07648873,-0.080083385,0.010312146,0.020422138,0.022205053,0.09719172,0.056995243,0.09145672,-0.05554181,0.01212347,-0.0626704,0.07452604,-0.08915677,0.021817787,-0.05053664,-0.06968908,0.0048974366,-0.013046912,-0.012003085,0.03126027,-0.09313169,-0.0005485743,0.082566686,-0.010389879,0.00949324,0.057952315,0.03700878,0.0070058834,-0.016808692,0.07958313,0.06878226,-0.07484352,3.406763e-33,-0.022731127,-0.053217724,0.008743671,0.07183155,-0.08522473,0.0022677188,-0.01887826,0.027881183,0.03186768,0.065862484,0.10350669,-0.06287072,0.029421251,0.009867913,0.02930008,0.0737858,-0.01867326,-0.0138516,-0.023514388,-0.021957202,0.0635228,-0.0028508771,0.05636709,-0.021458032,-0.045160856,-0.037547458,-0.04313718,0.07265136,0.014542935,-0.029156549,0.026835753,0.024380088,-0.044955403,0.054122027,-0.080853865,-0.028869653,0.05507193,-0.03891163,-0.012769436,0.06999364,-0.02664071,0.014775805,0.022247635,0.018887814,0.040181767,-0.098484114,-0.070521295,0.01670067,-0.06563288,0.014414956,-0.08879573,0.011304767,0.035972215,0.04929531,0.01582573,0.06341449,-0.03776546,-0.008450924,-0.049987517,0.02634994,0.0445416,0.0023432786,-0.03490828,0.101206765,0.07645321,0.13310835,-0.034649737,0.051254746,0.07082296,0.028146677,0.06386316,-0.011657582,-0.13400441,0.0042202324,-0.044055354,-0.05770962,0.026108226,0.057359423,0.018531503,-0.009261213,0.05233444,-0.058488898,-0.020078335,-0.107001565,-0.038827542,-0.015027584,-0.004094396,-0.0062401565,0.056113012,-0.123755045,0.02262378,-0.04156992,-0.051622167,-0.0061010537,-0.050243806,-3.9236947e-33,-0.029341057,0.036659323,0.039377324,0.061737154,-0.0036096117,0.02283821,0.04025111,-0.07089066,-0.11797559,-0.06477578,-0.08299244,-0.06763137,0.04968005,-0.047085404,-0.0201601,-0.033249155,0.053198192,0.00927189,-0.06356106,-0.023435356,-0.048752952,0.007543696,0.029650567,-0.041745182,-0.053834934,-0.00025348234,-0.06315635,-0.025881939,0.017189972,-0.09865299,-0.0113438545,-0.039528627,-0.03832659,0.054712035,-0.0425485,-0.038016174,0.1294906,0.12493255,-0.01786775,0.059122283,-0.052613184,0.0024603144,0.05141795,-0.115256496,-0.025375228,0.06478628,0.033475913,0.025487695,0.0064766835,0.0047766156,0.056435872,0.021408565,-0.004055713,0.030781953,-0.03666684,-0.023693722,-0.07459157,-0.00015333618,-0.050132964,-0.006331433,0.028853677,0.040182903,-0.12070654,0.084445894,-0.058229994,-0.011546151,-0.07163237,-0.041746333,0.02696895,-0.0035788189,-0.05354356,-0.013485291,0.010522176,-0.07034789,0.0041982844,0.01830507,0.0030195909,-0.05089518,0.017101416,-0.047413416,0.010735598,-0.09676163,-0.0069286856,-0.059795696,-0.015022144,-0.0033518896,0.020550082,-0.04599788,-0.05636114,0.06700478,-0.04585758,-0.027983304,-0.06114188,0.012068113,-0.01028122,-6.140606e-08,0.020162845,-0.002711479,0.029460587,0.016572388,0.035410795,0.016511278,-0.049844794,-0.10971702,-0.025714574,0.0010364109,0.0034492707,-0.00034856523,-0.048691373,0.0023186302,0.061494302,0.01775062,0.016514342,0.0065884916,0.047685385,-0.017690474,-0.08483308,-0.053919826,-0.0022996773,0.061041046,0.090678334,0.040044904,-0.0046496973,0.1247802,0.01967283,-0.028496651,0.043625433,-0.0060764435,0.082344286,-0.058234356,0.12751323,-0.004208265,-0.0006342901,0.028743707,0.048724618,-0.0419481,-0.03198357,0.041938722,0.013321731,0.02483745,0.023855923,-0.054416403,0.007090894,0.062377483,-0.05256452,-0.04900853,0.05553119,-0.03185331,0.020756895,-0.026646165,0.02252042,0.1026681,0.06288259,-0.028036784,-0.020067086,0.009608774,0.08772631,0.012465161,0.0134922685,-0.048998058,11,-27.023798,1.4508626,2
331,"calculated how to obtain the population mean from the sample mean, first single samples and then multiple samples. introduced confidence intervals as a method for estimation of the population mean and explained how one can calculate the chances of finding a range for the population mean given the level of certainty.

the standard error of the mean was covered. it uses the following formula to calculate it:
î¼ = ïƒ / âˆšn

we considered how the means of several samples together follow a normal distribution, where their average forms the estimate of the population's mean. the probabilities were expressed in terms of p-values.

we also calculated the values of the parameters î²â‚€ and î²â‚ in the linear regression model.

we end the class by discussing the anova table, which is used to test whether there are statistically significant differences between the means of three or more groups.

in the next lecture, we'll continue with multiple regression models.",0.0077354033,0.029838726,-0.0082589155,0.028726514,-0.015359003,0.03296821,-0.045283854,0.14467378,0.046814017,0.00764684,0.0576197,-0.05200322,0.03756285,-0.12704428,-0.0018179228,-0.03411364,-0.024620619,-0.04536933,-0.06126546,0.0135162035,0.09693604,0.033365164,0.11466103,0.02216408,-0.011382907,-0.044799663,-0.052481517,0.012500897,0.04584883,0.06306382,0.00055385527,0.027346566,0.044396374,0.04748,-0.042830244,-0.068848595,-0.056429155,0.018213917,0.017768843,0.057119563,0.008230554,-0.025671007,0.053393755,0.022556894,0.017839894,0.0018476326,-0.050559063,-0.0035162356,0.010522172,0.011858331,0.027538717,0.020021617,-0.026573604,-0.050560854,-0.11166855,-0.096225284,-0.0422199,-0.030953923,0.069948114,0.049945846,0.024308128,-0.0142226815,-0.0070980275,0.04008147,0.033107735,0.0317431,-0.06479342,-0.014512808,-0.0059753684,0.032204553,-0.07356072,0.014473773,-0.10291882,0.0029950587,0.037294637,-0.02610477,-0.0130936075,0.0127488,-0.045005467,0.015164167,0.071551524,-0.00906739,-0.006505512,-0.01839207,0.05517971,0.022533244,0.052223925,0.037333734,-0.017125571,-0.004381168,-0.004214595,0.021831423,-0.10108932,0.08316121,-0.022678355,0.054387674,-0.0344398,-0.0736972,0.13116463,0.027064249,0.015763449,-0.0026324168,0.04114252,-0.07638523,-0.07098605,0.006229421,0.036962554,-0.055588063,0.006533344,0.027894666,-0.092333905,-0.04041573,-0.066661134,0.060548007,0.02058879,-0.026612746,-0.00046802036,0.054427583,0.076347396,-0.023534534,0.08174247,0.035727803,0.083654985,-0.036387935,-0.0063792365,0.0012551256,-0.1289228,3.3540053e-33,-0.0020869537,-0.031984784,0.0114912605,0.10702691,0.01044572,0.02803795,-0.0649217,-0.022311391,-0.011072724,0.031814396,0.03915741,-0.08493991,0.027150726,0.006664738,0.039532535,0.12404727,0.0037822328,-0.0435816,-0.021796748,0.054354265,0.045174003,-0.055206843,0.054126557,0.04365697,-0.012527415,0.06583603,-0.01665303,0.06685007,0.01472626,-0.023512585,0.022533296,0.035408158,-0.111747,-0.09182335,0.011882585,0.049642794,0.04919962,0.02728777,-0.018220356,0.07382314,-0.01038134,0.030164741,0.10290491,-0.008728118,0.04165114,0.014866495,-0.06309129,0.048591167,-0.03344652,0.047032773,-0.100438274,-0.017363237,-0.042012665,0.060424574,-0.021864451,0.03280662,-0.12678917,0.086934574,-0.051518288,0.0099825235,0.02235162,-0.010178325,0.04297394,0.015944744,0.07999616,0.095717385,-0.06322301,0.049046375,0.05150905,0.04288162,0.06318632,-0.097065024,-0.059037827,0.019868273,-0.04504694,-0.018160895,0.013328238,0.010570632,0.07117541,-0.07495666,0.027401576,0.019184202,-0.094386116,-0.06410423,-0.012702556,-0.001095784,-0.0078092213,-0.02620564,0.017860584,-0.024696527,0.03804908,-0.0084118815,-0.019164087,-0.010308989,-0.0519262,-5.5815895e-33,0.058087748,0.12369883,0.037369613,0.0010416524,0.0070699877,-0.0075312504,0.074429266,-0.033934828,0.017119952,-0.010287559,-0.09188695,0.005789636,0.06300792,-0.0170836,0.056385513,0.021636942,0.05647877,-0.09094128,-0.033843346,-0.03379968,0.005256327,-0.011592734,0.031708103,0.01417871,-0.10577737,-0.0031188068,-0.05663495,0.0025957637,-0.07942809,-0.1279705,-0.006104697,-0.104107805,-0.016396763,-0.024613554,-0.03483391,0.0009231731,0.008377038,0.051294696,0.008750941,0.029884044,0.013257097,0.019223116,0.01705723,-0.10557373,0.015754461,0.1292041,0.09378248,-0.042414255,-0.016256263,-0.06857679,0.016971547,-0.034485344,-0.044971984,0.024277715,0.0003511667,-0.049476586,-0.006954799,-0.060742848,-0.02006393,0.016394818,-0.02599529,0.012973495,-0.08490068,0.08186354,-0.07103082,-0.022228103,-0.051230628,-0.043876436,-0.017143475,0.036600478,-0.04078587,-0.04149784,0.04019942,-0.05345824,-0.038040522,-0.022488434,-0.078732915,-0.031792153,0.030352043,-0.0064895004,-0.0459808,-0.045608737,0.019302996,-0.06929929,0.0102432,-0.11914949,0.09201351,0.011294481,-0.013971332,0.014594429,-0.056121442,0.054958217,-0.0377587,-0.053223774,0.043968458,-6.2931186e-08,0.057669394,0.037035946,0.0066912114,-0.031262733,0.019284902,0.04664398,-0.07435768,-0.008090902,-0.01332356,-0.02214872,-0.0011299377,-0.048468076,0.016450778,-0.017402144,0.018386094,0.09819416,-0.026720164,0.09204949,-0.016376244,-0.028415212,-0.016583363,-0.061996374,-0.028132215,-0.043139763,0.08432599,0.051950995,-0.027024513,0.054906607,-0.05436056,0.091662444,-0.026984144,-0.021386176,0.06335361,-0.048434783,0.07853832,0.032221347,0.00061690656,-0.02264083,0.14813274,-0.044423584,-0.002738051,-0.06266457,-0.013492607,0.050488632,0.065279104,0.025455864,0.025906812,0.0027428623,-0.007350173,-0.017352488,0.033216286,-0.028622054,-0.08316395,0.083700486,-0.041101553,0.04464618,0.0032174187,0.010368071,0.03557063,-0.12788759,0.040991314,-0.007555405,-0.027127428,-0.040822342,11,-25.279112,-0.05297303,2

todays class topic was of calculating population means from the sample mean which was presented in the context of both single-sample and the multiple-sample methods. we also studied confidence intervals, which are used to predict the range within a population mean that may have a probability attached to it.the standard error of the mean (se) is represented by this formula: se= square root (pop. standard dev. squared/ sample size). once the mean of several different random samples is plotted in a graph, a distribution of the mean will be normally shaped and the mean of such sample means will act as an estimation of the population mean. we learned about p-value statistics for the calculations of probabilities.we also carried out the determination of linear regression model coefficients for beta zero as well as beta one.we also got to learn the anova table, which looks into differences between the means of three or more groups to ascertain if they are significant.

342,"today, first of all we saw the various population parameters like mean, variance and sample mean, variance. we learnt about the central limit theoram over some counter example of estimation of working hours of manager of a company. here we took the sample of 18 observations which was considered to represent the whole population. we then plotted the probability density function (pdf) for the sample mean and explored confidence intervals, along with the application of the t-distribution for sample sizes smaller than 30 observations. then we came to know about the practical importance of confidence intervals. thenafter, we saw statistical parameters and learnt to calculate them like t value, z and many more. in the end we had a discussion on p value and a brief discussion of multiple linear

351,"in todayâ€™s class, we discussed how to predict population parameters using a single sample. we calculated the sample mean and standard deviation, assuming they approximate the population values, and derived the standard deviation of the sampling distribution to plot the sampling curve. a 95% confidence interval was explained as the range within which the mean of 95 out of 100 samples would lie, providing a probabilistic understanding. the difference between t-statistics (used for sample distributions) and z-statistics (used for population distributions) was highlighted, with the formula differing due to the standard deviation source. we explored the concept of p-value, emphasizing that a p-value below 0.05 indicates statistical significance, and discussed its role in determining whether coefficients are statistically equivalent to zero. this aids in feature selection for multiple linear regression, where anova is used to assess the statistical equivalence of multiple averages

366,"in this session, the instructor discussed several key statistical concepts, including error distributions, standard error, sample means, and the central limit theorem (clt). a significant takeaway was that for regression models to accurately reflect the true trend in the data, the errors must be normally distributed. if the errors can be predicted, it suggests that the model has not fully captured the underlying trend of the sample, which may lead to biased results.

the session outlined how to estimate the population mean from a sample, which involves three main steps:

1.) first, calculate the sample mean, assuming it is close to 0. the standard error (sxbar) is found by dividing the population's standard deviation (sigma) by the square root of the sample size (n).
2.) next, compute the sampleâ€™s standard deviation, assuming it is a good estimate of the population's standard deviation.
3.) finally, calculate the standard deviation of the sample distribution, which is essential for determining the confidence interval (ci) that indicates where the population mean is likely to be. for example, a 95% ci means that 95 out of 100 sample means will fall within that range.

the session also delved into the concept of standard error, which reflects how much the sample mean might differ from the actual population mean. for a normal distribution, the standard error is calculated as
ð‘ /âˆšð‘›
, where ð‘  represents the sample standard deviation and ð‘› is the sample size.

following this, the instructor explained the differences between normal and t distributions. when the population standard deviation is known, the errors follow a normal distribution. conversely, if the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is less than 30, the data adheres to a t distribution. the z-statistic and t-statistic serve as test statistics for normal and t distributions, respectively.

the concept of the p-value was introduced, with a focus on its connection to the confidence interval. a low p-value indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, while a high p-value suggests weak evidence. the session also pointed out that if ð›½1 in the regression equation ð‘¦=ð›½0+ð›½1(ð‘¥) is statistically equivalent to 0, then the regression model lacks significance.

additionally, the session delved into multiple linear regression and anova (analysis of variance) as methods for comparing statistical equivalence among multiple averages. the f-statistic, calculated as ð‘€ð‘†ð‘…/ð‘€ð‘†ð¸, is utilized to evaluate the overall fit of a model in anova, determining whether the group means differ significantly.

in summary, the session offered a thorough understanding of statistical inferences, emphasizing essential concepts like standard error, p-values, confidence intervals, and the importance of regression models in data analysis. these concepts are crucial for effective data analysis and informed decision-making in

422,"- we learned how to measure key things like the average (mean) and how spread out the data is (variance) within a population.
- the prof used a real-world example â€“ figuring out how much extra time managers work on average. we used a small group of managers (only 18!) to represent the whole company. then, we visualized how the average overtime hours might vary across different samples using a special graph called a probability density function (pdf).
- making smart decisions: we learned about confidence intervals, which are like a range where the true average likely falls. since we had a small sample size, we used something called the t-distribution to calculate these intervals. our teacher emphasized how useful confidence intervals are for making informed decisions based on data.
- we explored important terms like t-values and z-values, which help us understand how likely our results are. we also discussed what it means when we say two things are ""statistically different"" â€“ basically, that the difference between them is real and not just due to chance.
- we got a quick introduction to p-values, which are another way to assess the significance of our findings.

429,"one small insight i learned in todayâ€™s class is that one sample can have multiple observations because a sample is like a smaller set of data taken from the entire population.

in todayâ€™s class, we focused on confidence intervals and why theyâ€™re important.

we spent almost half of the class understanding how we can use a sample to figure out the populationâ€™s parameters, like the mean, by making some assumptions:

1. the sample represents the population well.
2. the standard deviation of the sample is roughly the same as the standard deviation of the population.

to estimate the population mean, we used the **central limit theorem**. it says that if you have a sample size n>30, you can use the z-distribution to calculate the confidence interval. if n<30, you use the t-distribution instead.

toward the end of the class, we looked at the **anova table** in excel and tried to understand some of the values it gives, like:

- **p-stats**: this is calculated using the formula:
    - p-stats= (x - x_) / (standard_deviation / sqrt(n)) ; where n is the number of samples
- **p-value**: this tells us how good a regression model is. it checks if the parameter î²1 (slope of the regression line) is statistically different from 0. if the p-value is very small, it means î²1 is significant, so the regression line is meaningful. if the p-value is large, it means î²1 is not statistically different from 0, which implies thereâ€™s no slope, and therefore no valid regression line.

we also discussed why confidence intervals are helpful. they donâ€™t just give us a single estimate (like the mean) but a range where the actual value is likely to fall. this makes our predictions more reliable.

lastly, the class touched on how these concepts connect to regression analysis. for example, when using the regression output in excel, understanding the p-value, confidence intervals, and other stats helps us decide if the model is good enough or needs improvement.",-0.036960408,0.036186516,-0.0018106422,-0.008670072,-0.014770915,-0.0057235747,-0.05851647,0.13169947,0.075266376,0.063467726,0.018989045,-0.0131464945,0.041695777,-0.11114767,0.025049593,-0.07327778,0.031991735,-0.048854295,-0.0151351085,-0.008760766,0.062366415,0.013890425,0.091036916,0.02788016,-0.042693023,-0.019105606,-0.083847195,-0.035450276,0.036942773,0.043346208,-0.002960667,0.092718855,0.06729194,0.03654733,-0.08661494,-0.11107931,-0.051135674,0.09205742,0.010504313,0.08161929,0.031780433,0.031797525,-0.019509088,0.040647928,-0.031452764,-0.014742223,-0.03488949,-0.025223987,-0.014748218,0.060443144,-0.0236097,0.08821331,-0.07991565,-0.004518582,-0.05270898,-0.053474672,-0.073159285,-0.02980026,0.034186736,0.05864461,0.032791782,-0.0523702,0.04184989,0.042704675,0.05899243,-0.03412223,-0.037030965,-0.0275404,0.027965298,-0.045494813,-0.08708617,0.0028572336,-0.046308223,0.06354865,-0.015157385,-0.022510355,-0.035442065,-0.0136302505,-0.034910597,-0.001168835,0.06299538,0.009143415,-0.009888851,0.0028903305,0.06290139,0.02325779,0.033495586,0.11540991,-0.009748298,0.023080477,0.03325143,0.074799985,-0.10141537,0.06039705,-0.025486939,0.025752466,-0.07451945,0.0069688214,0.067480154,-0.004669409,0.052934695,0.035284854,0.13365033,-0.018644068,-0.07418718,-0.1042727,0.040465258,-0.06130407,-0.0063801464,0.01944969,-0.056810945,-0.023053538,-0.057502564,-0.021014823,0.071531884,-0.010635247,-0.051409163,0.09627935,0.048622474,0.0072418605,0.04636912,0.0018097997,-0.01594897,-0.02437666,0.06563875,0.0636323,-0.08495881,2.2995595e-33,-0.015795775,-0.0016777887,-0.041506447,0.10219055,-0.041785955,0.04819455,-0.025895668,0.02572229,-0.021092318,0.061784595,0.059379928,-0.061314527,0.06985914,0.0057235393,0.0030783254,0.119727954,-0.036315575,-0.025369868,-0.059680294,0.021352345,0.05266381,-0.03503138,0.052919257,0.050538074,-0.032644782,0.067230694,-0.037990276,0.068805546,0.010313587,-0.027409144,0.002948009,0.016075004,-0.08674888,-0.07118493,0.05589398,-0.0031376365,0.1022322,0.010742698,-0.02906256,-0.002543066,-0.034680273,0.05739548,0.062717296,0.08059326,0.017629353,-0.030619754,-0.05909664,-0.009939462,0.005101182,0.02890622,-0.0787655,-0.023150764,-0.029516296,0.033987552,0.006229868,0.08197584,-0.06595988,0.067329116,-0.047902822,0.023184704,0.024935152,-0.043483492,0.0042019286,0.04875925,0.09307418,0.12313335,-0.09036003,0.07337271,0.034320943,0.08431634,0.0783369,-0.07538713,-0.13269229,-0.040539194,-0.049787592,-0.06849028,0.05764811,0.016776254,0.044369902,-0.06090002,-0.024190824,-0.07486317,-0.05236213,-0.05387718,-0.03963217,-0.0013548485,0.025154352,0.018709483,0.061433274,-0.09109428,0.022353882,-0.060018282,-0.06908256,0.0118273,-0.1021051,-4.212699e-33,-0.022826714,0.12595908,-0.032870986,0.022487007,-2.1997565e-05,0.0034464144,0.029363941,-0.033344623,-0.022953687,-0.07928489,-0.025658412,0.025590595,0.07351806,-0.049637306,0.009305188,-0.004611589,0.068255804,-0.020587979,-0.08395995,-0.064417586,-0.06300142,-0.07156558,0.00023397229,-0.03936823,-0.04966029,0.043799188,-0.10265434,-0.060944468,-0.02112686,-0.09285657,-0.007582074,-0.08567556,-0.0072258855,0.008474968,-0.03948528,0.0030138353,0.0028223905,0.052299988,0.009519809,-0.020805294,0.0072014336,-0.05128028,0.06990599,-0.07299781,-0.049426343,0.12442529,0.018263733,-0.025105685,0.00647135,0.022371009,0.06004858,0.0137054,0.0050201663,0.004455656,0.03897522,-0.012632861,-0.0010461028,-0.029794008,-0.026563954,-0.015984224,0.02321802,0.0032156603,-0.11377367,0.03558821,-0.11438059,-0.03774521,-0.005246754,-0.034922324,-0.020739172,0.053106382,-0.041655507,0.07649638,-0.02148572,-0.08925113,-0.08018945,0.003536075,-0.02080463,-0.007858257,0.026084352,-0.027050892,-0.023037633,-0.013372923,0.023853254,-0.07602502,0.009177882,-0.04038582,0.047333613,-0.018547265,-0.010165622,0.074583955,0.010030029,0.012065776,-0.056064006,-0.026384333,-0.007076296,-6.312116e-08,0.035081726,0.012934241,-0.018802656,-0.0009699789,0.08309378,0.011776283,-0.06560958,-0.008738424,0.040650036,0.0074552624,0.07530673,-0.02650533,0.005384493,0.003755648,0.05941482,0.05822205,0.02487212,0.018695598,0.004804004,0.015263306,-0.041641496,-0.07408051,-0.0143061085,-0.01877397,0.08186789,0.08249218,-0.024853248,0.032915406,0.005646631,0.00034699787,0.004136581,-0.053809233,0.0569393,-0.016492732,0.091757745,0.004044277,-0.012744722,-0.026906036,0.0565045,-0.036151197,-0.054768164,-0.08171081,-0.009643864,0.021918016,0.054761067,-0.00086568657,-0.055768125,-0.0001126594,-0.028992573,0.07102367,0.011327207,-0.00070465286,-0.031704318,0.00799788,-0.011497935,0.07670013,0.052411813,-0.040619228,-0.025630757,-0.09353369,0.043830384,0.036951754,-0.046817467,-0.038376857,11,-27.659164,0.7220157,2
443,"we started the lecture plotting the regression line. the data had x and y values and we determined the values of a and b of the line y=ax+b using the formulae given on excel. we plot the scatter plot showing relationship between and x and y variables and we plot the regression line calculated which gives the estimated function. we calculated the metrics, sse, mse, rmse, mae, used for assessing accuracy of the models. we plotted the histogram for assessing randomness in errors. then we used data analysis tool pak to conduct regression using anova and uploaded the t-statistics and p-values at particular confidence intervals. the standard deviation represents the standard error, hence more the sample size, smaller the error. then we studied the central limit theorem which helps in deriving inferences about population from sample

453,"in today's lecture, we about analyzing the distribution of the data. on performing linear regression the error plot of the data appears very random, so we need to choose an appropriate error metric to properly make sense of our observations. thus we need to choose an suitable model so that we can explain the behavior being depicted by a data set. metrics can be sse, mse, rmse, mae, etc. we validated this on the dataset in excel. we used excel's lr tool to approximate a and b value of regression. then we learnt about central limit theorem, ""the distribution of sample means will be approximately normal if the sample size is large enough"" using the population example. this means that as n approaches infinity, the distribution of sample means (and standard deviations) will closely resemble the mean(and standard deviations)  of the population

471,"in real life we should never use the entire sample for training the model, instead randomly take some (practically 20%) of the data and treat it as test data unseen by the model. this is used to compare the performance of different we may create to solve the problem.
multiple r is nothing but the square root of the r^2 metric for the case of mlr, and it represents some form of correlation between y and all of the x.
linear regression only means that we will solve for a linear combination of the features, it does not restrain what those features may be, and whether the trend of the predictions will be linear (line or hyperplane) or not.
the matrix form doesn't restrict y to be just one row / column, it can also be a matrix, in which case we would just be predicting multiple outputs from the features.
if we know the mean, then one of the sample loses its value, and hence we say that the degrees of freedom are reduced when we are calculating the values of ssr and sst because both formulas require the mean of something. when we divide them by their respective degrees of freedom and then use them to calculate r^2, it is called adjusted r^2.
quantile-quantile plot or qq plot is a plot that can tell how close a distribution is to the normal distribution. ideally it should be the y = x line, more the deviation from this line, more the distribution is different than a normal distribution.",-0.03729302,-0.049096256,-0.10772943,-0.0076225703,0.08505448,0.10320456,-0.08457345,0.006883803,0.08247058,0.010889622,-0.01563789,0.099358,-0.01910727,0.05365363,0.0069682985,-0.0055041215,-0.07008598,0.030602776,-0.0507836,0.026896816,0.095078945,-0.045214787,-0.03941556,0.08981958,0.026683122,0.029903363,0.018175142,0.00023454074,-0.044381745,0.045980353,0.048017975,0.049441006,0.007843113,0.0352386,-0.13528506,-0.06115165,0.013421051,0.043999158,0.055669326,0.031337757,-0.033669256,-0.074437514,0.024230951,0.02834677,0.052333884,0.008089731,-0.029728428,-0.11693007,-0.045444623,0.010076326,-0.039780024,0.0037832065,-0.025508314,-0.028360598,-0.006580478,-0.10794626,-0.047250632,-0.0026817417,-0.007285821,0.04648205,-0.013321656,-0.05129163,-0.023347562,0.013675086,-0.0033904489,-0.023861669,-0.07680311,0.021824943,-0.034300618,-0.00933363,-0.07352033,0.019801518,-0.034848776,-0.045804895,-0.014111851,-0.010343773,0.078667216,0.0064943787,0.009706895,0.09807015,0.08363164,0.107962266,-0.009900786,-0.009234661,-0.011465076,-0.04419902,-0.0070023458,-0.034059092,0.05361488,0.03937114,0.07302702,0.0037642587,-0.066710874,-0.0008356462,-0.05301369,0.015919305,0.012766484,-0.021480132,0.04806776,-0.019713463,0.043295637,0.044646032,0.018129032,0.037872758,0.032945476,-0.045045286,0.08991886,-0.011276441,0.09804176,-0.057252325,0.017224027,-0.0042820703,-0.126024,0.07961884,-0.015350482,-0.026745006,-0.1048749,0.04010756,-0.029295085,0.009185328,-0.04947172,0.018995415,0.11100328,-0.00251162,0.068776205,0.0106794415,-0.17848898,3.299023e-33,-0.027009008,0.052002165,0.0018579105,-0.014120718,0.018230472,-0.031167611,-0.056412227,-0.013599453,0.09878703,0.046551652,0.068317264,-0.044099133,0.02664055,0.037220668,0.017590467,0.076223,-0.015363987,0.0153434705,0.0073158583,-0.0036576404,0.03334463,0.00011961419,0.04894668,-0.0066915145,-0.07966593,-0.077489905,0.05020127,0.072694875,-0.099997796,-0.0056479783,-0.029354375,0.04221692,-0.07531783,0.036360912,0.027163267,-0.06117856,-0.019418607,-0.024000047,0.048629444,0.012537721,-0.004290175,0.0071365414,0.080064684,-0.010385362,0.07698884,0.06448933,-0.05025395,0.065476276,-0.08138385,0.055480473,-0.024064114,0.0037441626,-0.034299035,-0.0013022172,0.08105785,0.09436631,-0.10860923,-0.029943367,-0.029154085,0.009314278,-0.119213834,-0.09950407,0.021373589,-0.07903046,0.06513342,0.04780266,-0.0010206467,-0.007182105,0.020795552,0.07179407,0.036906235,-0.057398655,0.020840175,-0.05156439,0.044187676,-0.05871216,0.07807699,0.013158286,0.040913,0.023206258,-0.0103003755,0.13381246,-0.01845267,-0.04697481,-0.043989707,-0.03895899,0.030065615,-0.09256194,0.060616616,0.019199204,-0.049652763,-0.020895598,-0.113646254,-0.034999352,-0.045549706,-4.9224425e-33,0.0023722912,0.0610581,-0.05665944,-0.012207577,-0.022247806,-0.06800869,-0.0037507808,0.0027210822,0.021892862,-0.06215334,0.047460288,-0.064523995,-0.026120067,0.05448652,0.06910176,0.044265855,-0.0009902477,-0.06279338,-0.09821833,-0.020856729,-0.00020533962,0.03562832,0.03481966,0.010803197,0.001860517,-0.03717265,-0.060129344,0.08507673,-0.0078050774,-0.012050512,-0.0030672222,-0.02719444,0.01559914,-0.07585451,0.02818348,0.061446242,-0.015001501,-0.013839988,0.06547055,0.038348597,-0.005494648,0.011919607,-0.0009952155,-0.001703083,-0.009595806,0.04717921,0.04370496,-0.016061429,0.06468087,-0.020716645,-0.032079965,-0.012769525,-0.07120352,0.0010313332,0.022654915,-0.0725692,-0.089293845,0.029612953,-0.05484367,-0.0003567437,0.061711207,-0.0026697952,-0.11832551,0.060951315,-0.02160023,-0.041995484,0.04935496,-0.04230085,0.061423667,0.07421554,-0.03761902,-0.067314036,0.032910742,-0.0076348484,-0.019676762,-0.054059662,-0.05333248,-0.095423356,-0.08587883,0.008414624,-0.018453399,-0.011666954,0.005687641,-0.04138509,-0.039526466,0.025193544,0.03134702,0.065388806,-0.0027686248,-0.078195356,0.029197019,0.02145032,-0.05313778,0.06889964,0.02529119,-6.9923445e-08,-0.038750842,-0.0056287157,0.03127356,-0.057784714,0.023118386,-0.0033580984,-0.00017938217,-0.0075146803,0.00043656968,0.079887755,0.04855689,-0.02910265,-0.119019166,-0.037033904,0.020095615,-0.0046578827,-0.059429888,0.038388573,-0.018771058,0.0042222417,0.03141174,-0.05325817,-0.018556101,0.009352052,0.048978914,-0.0032726286,0.024926994,0.079125576,-0.016214782,0.024514364,0.03248832,-0.018660909,0.12858173,0.056181144,0.02947086,-0.02076975,0.08892166,-0.029205289,0.10555878,0.0066596745,-0.058360264,0.020141555,-0.03807502,0.038814306,0.06419375,0.0398219,0.045088023,0.019906152,-0.017267,-0.06739184,-0.021366423,0.0033263953,0.032726463,0.046343163,0.061245646,0.07914498,-0.053141396,0.06710543,-0.006729472,0.021549659,-0.02430543,0.012003687,-0.014189334,-0.097211294,8,-9.407064,2.6631782,2
477,"we started the session by learning how to calculate things like the average (mean), variability (variance), and other important statistics for a population. the instructor explained the central limit theorem with an example of estimating the extra work hours of managers in a company. we worked with a small sample of 18 people, assuming it represented the entire population.

we plotted a graph (pdf) showing the likelihood of different average work hours for the sample and learned about confidence intervals, including how to use the t-distribution when the sample size is small (less than 30). the instructor also explained why confidence intervals are important in real-life applications.

later, we covered other statistical concepts like t-values, z-values, and how to calculate them. the idea of being ""statistically different"" was introduced, and the session ended with a discussion on p-values and a quick introduction to multiple linear

494,"the session focused on key concepts in multiple linear regression, model evaluation, and data partitioning. it began with a discussion on the importance of not using the entire sample population for model training. instead, datasets are typically divided into training and test sets in an 80-20% ratio to ensure unbiased model performance evaluation. the significance of multiple r and r-square was explored, where multiple r represents the correlation between dependent and independent variables, and r-square measures the explained variance. the calculation of variance in samples was also addressed, emphasizing the adjustment for degrees of freedom by using (xi - xì„)â² / (n - 1) instead of (xi - xì„)â² / n.

feature selection was discussed in the context of p-values, where features with a p-value greater than 0.05 were considered statistically insignificant and removed to optimize the model. additionally, model selection and evaluation metrics such as the akaike information criterion (aic) were introduced, highlighting that a lower aic value indicates a better-fitting model. the omnibus statistic and omnibus p-value were also covered as measures for assessing the overall goodness of fit and the normality of residuals.

the session concluded with an explanation of the closed-form solution in multiple linear regression, which relies on matrix inversion techniques to obtain optimal parameter estimates. overall, the discussion provided a structured understanding of statistical foundations, feature selection, and model evaluation techniques essential for effective machine

507,"we studied how to determine the population mean from sample means in today's session, taking into account both single and multiple samples. in order to estimate a population mean and determine the likelihood that a population mean will fall within a particular interval at a certain probability, we investigated confidence intervals. the formula for calculating the standard error of the mean is ïƒ/âˆšn. the sample mean is an estimate of the population mean, and the means of several samples combine to form a normal distribution. we also spoke about how to assess probability by calculating the p-value. we also learned how to calculate a linear regression model's coefficients (î²â‚€ and î²â‚). the anova table, which determines if there are statistically significant differences between the means of three or more samples, was the last topic we

509,"plotted a regression line of the data uploaded on moodle. the data contained x and y values, and we used excel formulas to find the values of a and b of the line y=ax+b. the regression line is computed and it provides the estimated function that is plotted alongside the scatter plot that illustrates the relationship between the x and y variables. the metrics used to evaluate the models' accuracyâ€”sse, mse, rmse, and mae were computed. to determine the degree of unpredictability, we plotted the histogram. next, we performed regression using anova utilizing the data analysis tool pak, uploading the t-statistics and p-values at specific confidence ranges. the standard error is represented by the standard deviation; hence, the larger the sample size, the smaller the error. after that, we looked at the central limit theorem which helps in deriving inferences about population from sample means.",0.009723402,-0.0122229075,-0.06567961,0.045930192,0.007990479,0.0053337007,-0.06554157,0.11941179,0.009798215,0.049123306,0.02260061,0.016068825,0.042931702,-0.026795244,-0.00045116062,-0.060507003,0.017533658,-0.10375546,-0.0057355654,-0.041850567,0.119982146,0.02426463,-0.040582076,-0.0016196483,0.03032207,-0.014530951,-0.07506201,0.035228517,-0.048273344,-0.0025267005,-0.03862872,0.03509889,0.04265575,0.058764268,-0.073085636,-0.075254574,0.01865093,0.056723572,0.0339381,0.023151938,-0.005735596,0.0030823906,0.046211623,0.0045928694,0.025583956,-0.03928274,-0.07939034,-0.0253671,-0.05541379,0.07141329,-0.056510262,0.011493182,-0.029114263,-0.019554999,-0.0042410386,-0.02414511,-0.030492214,-0.0069428,0.06901637,0.030046938,0.017532226,0.054656323,-0.010779896,0.03640123,0.09366136,0.016238432,-0.052832063,-0.026520222,0.028021606,0.04934576,-0.05324422,-0.009642575,-0.06543219,0.025609825,0.0087536555,-0.030895567,-0.08362228,0.06377791,0.016802188,-0.07099015,-0.020363955,0.019938258,0.0018372874,0.050412387,0.012777465,0.0037181072,0.07705937,0.06980461,0.034076437,0.043816287,0.0087249605,0.023560425,-0.09464446,0.07388823,0.025131905,0.057705756,-0.039758235,-0.06972926,0.06621839,0.023409896,0.055180762,0.09049132,0.025790246,0.02616722,-0.043883227,-0.029195435,0.10594498,-0.06815923,0.054518268,-0.011580819,-0.028646432,0.018507548,-0.049193565,0.023571214,0.08555209,-0.079747185,-0.05810029,0.080442935,-0.030700263,-0.0068888646,0.07763704,0.049343623,-0.004321534,0.03490118,0.018930065,0.03605048,-0.12353061,4.086672e-34,-0.004952399,0.026998261,0.025504557,0.043016404,-0.024689559,-0.039660648,-0.10237151,-0.0042034714,0.028623387,0.08743401,-0.05919266,0.028563797,-0.050039783,0.026610652,0.09356673,0.09570984,0.016795283,0.023451278,-0.08884934,0.0059877075,0.03737875,-0.10054969,0.022145452,-0.025426503,-0.020532904,0.005294558,-0.03088501,0.100307725,-0.0287825,-0.008760401,0.023112949,-0.01271387,-0.021109866,-0.049189806,0.013993408,-0.06544711,0.010185249,0.0008103351,0.064280614,0.10614498,0.02119749,0.08009819,0.082814135,0.077109136,-0.020744797,0.044924207,-0.023695968,-0.02131622,0.038278624,0.047381848,-0.09911601,-0.012958423,0.005151163,0.02223793,-0.04038365,0.11743381,0.017661164,0.0025415402,-0.03111301,0.0102816755,0.008107847,-0.013317942,0.026557071,-0.053955615,0.037971634,0.105959944,-0.051154952,0.009042459,0.028083315,0.030194584,-0.054927528,-0.013899869,-0.04867662,0.0039216084,-0.04555632,-0.079183996,0.024658991,0.033728708,-0.018651059,-0.100595884,-0.054855328,-0.021800188,-0.061674725,-0.10634199,-0.054922163,-0.07535332,0.023975598,0.01182574,-0.023563866,-0.011951269,0.017931636,0.05005762,-0.015064037,-0.06595425,-0.0765739,-2.4764108e-33,-0.09526722,0.100135155,0.004547916,0.07547234,-0.0109303035,0.030970642,0.050571322,0.0039793146,0.04803159,-0.008285744,-0.03238018,0.0012459761,0.072254345,-0.016877055,0.018767219,-0.0034628427,-0.0021282434,-0.028312813,-0.10587852,-0.071400814,-0.009310639,0.027378488,0.07862828,-0.046192646,-0.07889855,0.062506095,-0.100360006,-0.007445789,-0.09106734,-0.112778,0.041522592,0.008974763,-0.08973837,-0.076540016,0.004484529,-0.0015123361,-0.01943604,-0.01009483,0.010433192,0.019579865,0.05061257,0.08262657,-0.0133433,-0.09384528,0.03540424,0.065768674,0.04541304,-0.017710121,0.073111795,-0.012798196,0.07673929,0.039324988,0.0010722153,0.018197417,0.015489233,-0.026316348,-0.009859057,-0.053204935,-0.11158936,-0.030792484,-0.025474532,-0.04564147,-0.085191414,0.019125996,-0.11700198,-0.051734,-0.019272782,-0.019383285,0.055509806,0.06786532,0.018936248,-0.032556973,0.018341413,-0.067953534,-0.055696633,-0.038979784,-0.08970688,0.033699807,0.022281548,-0.01731414,0.041281592,0.056242015,0.08344548,-0.08522286,-0.015287246,-0.026804633,0.03694963,-0.008142025,-0.022850046,0.06451907,-0.044149898,-0.033565074,-0.09759154,-0.028757252,0.055782657,-6.190561e-08,-0.016513582,-0.02152688,0.0047618756,0.027159758,0.01825187,0.020415254,-0.010374738,0.032817755,0.032282814,-0.0057399874,0.020481404,-0.008020831,-0.06920382,0.014818748,-0.030801695,0.058476534,0.0678194,0.09115436,-0.03096465,-0.09102952,-0.03844979,-0.02534551,-0.08401428,0.0018434714,0.100100346,0.0146876145,-0.08421111,0.0976792,-0.03928187,0.077994205,0.050745465,-0.05602516,0.057863463,-0.057506353,0.06493115,-0.00038961976,-0.008507065,0.06419596,0.09888005,0.034709796,-0.000857147,0.01690546,-0.053207207,0.0542501,0.049048655,-0.019864898,0.049302794,0.037401814,-0.04805375,-0.026064634,0.07510192,-0.031012096,-0.06620935,-0.0212826,-0.022105923,-0.025449462,-0.06434085,0.049548965,-0.05646019,-0.0326395,0.052310683,0.013486814,0.0009701319,-0.06719414,10,-24.692606,5.9203506,2
511,"practically we never have whole population data, we only have a sample data (called dataset). we should never use complete sample data to train the model rather only around 80% of data randomly, rest 20% is used to test and compare different models developed for the task.
multiple r = sqrt(r^2), this is a metric which tells us some kind of correlation between independent and dependent variables.
in general linear regression, we could have multiple features and even multiple outputs which have matrix form solution.
we want to know variance captured per independent variable(degree of freedom). if we know sample mean then we require one less sample so degree of freedom reduces. we use sample mean in both ssr and sst so when we adjust them with degree of freedom and use them in r^3 formula, it is called adjusted r^2.
adjusted r^2 = 1 - ((ssr/(n-k-1))/(sst/(n-1)))

522,"in todays class (24/1/25),
we started with stating out a formal assumption: in closed form solution, errors are always normally distributed. whatever be the distribution of the population, when we take out multiple samples and plot a histogram as a continuous frequency function, it forms a normal distribution.
next we discussed about the 3 steps to perform while estimating population mean from a sample
1. calculate the mean of the sample
2. get the sample standard deviation and assume it to be close to population standard deviation
3. now you can get the standard error
than based on the confidence interval, you can get the most likely population mean based on your confidence interval.
we completed and understood the following using an exercise of a researcher planning to estimate the extra hours put forward by the manager towards the company.
the key note for the following was, lower the confidence you want for your measurement, the value estimation will turn down to a point.
later, using the experiment we understood the significance of t-value, p-value, analysis on variance (anova) and relation with sample variables and gaussian distribution.",-0.012800522,0.09842559,0.024490997,0.059817832,-0.07328712,-0.04808366,-0.03976294,0.11723703,-0.035189357,-0.008918105,0.005114393,-0.10236199,0.03223888,-0.09983811,0.019827357,-0.080440015,0.017855527,-0.0089864,-0.044471283,-0.07797308,0.041229382,0.011077259,0.05587221,0.048891608,-0.041546505,-0.0154428035,4.9753353e-06,-0.0054652337,0.031889874,0.032722972,0.0033487552,0.0120210005,0.063189745,0.01980804,-0.0011719766,-0.020927547,-0.0541342,0.0664675,0.07765701,0.00845346,0.026380247,0.016111448,0.01454159,0.08010327,-0.08734595,-0.0037790255,0.016720783,0.009231803,-0.025568174,0.1410195,0.0010412743,0.074056596,0.029303724,-0.046246238,-0.043947075,0.011641499,-0.03794553,-0.087558545,0.048529226,0.1110964,0.023800824,-0.02144782,-0.006778041,-0.037267268,0.031943876,0.013044121,-0.026725749,-0.00017729847,0.0026060757,-0.005505204,-0.059926897,-0.030177413,-0.074132875,0.04549669,-0.07801152,-0.025660275,-0.020329062,0.02136624,-0.006332291,-0.031445473,0.08288655,-0.011089722,0.012308347,0.043168202,0.025059095,0.0139045315,0.06735009,0.2084009,0.003410553,-0.02951234,0.013448672,0.05516276,-0.09962496,0.016753962,0.04967601,0.050478604,-0.07617941,-0.009425791,0.08490171,0.03271274,0.02792426,0.012022031,0.043957982,-0.074060775,-0.0758197,-0.016913915,-0.014395205,0.02370719,-0.0359737,0.014601721,-0.024797056,-0.012053107,-0.055077855,-0.00087398826,0.1487853,0.04018613,-0.076307155,0.051506475,0.012453575,0.0041108774,0.056031786,0.05509618,0.076800205,-0.017215401,0.0103664445,0.020464726,0.01952546,3.89779e-33,-0.042160656,-0.020408886,-0.033679646,0.10552713,-0.004268375,0.060542542,-0.056812074,0.05995286,0.078452505,0.0029330049,0.032621555,-0.0695991,-0.00023677852,-0.08164621,-0.024470313,0.0848324,0.062084563,0.05642777,-0.07283409,-0.011784249,0.05830056,-0.10427783,-0.009220303,0.00510738,0.05621025,0.029840056,-0.0027793602,0.0012742248,0.07767681,-0.03615734,0.07303945,0.00028410074,-0.055858362,-0.015358553,0.0017457509,-0.05594653,0.051078852,0.053003635,-0.068852015,0.064794205,-0.028449968,0.08024171,0.095289186,0.055839483,-0.012505721,-0.0005607685,-0.0071072592,-0.06374833,0.024570728,0.06613326,-0.08504923,-0.028117638,-0.03556846,-0.020292133,0.0028656146,0.047117416,-0.011100789,-0.012486551,-0.010322089,0.030281065,0.0313025,-0.02924301,-0.005930578,0.007458422,0.07800023,0.115573816,-0.05264648,0.040185913,0.019357566,0.0060220575,0.078782685,-0.08377072,-0.059559375,0.010450229,-0.041482642,-0.039226584,0.009904657,0.073052004,-0.028918691,-0.009461773,0.071755946,-0.06325773,-0.068671435,-0.03038369,0.087162234,0.012791873,0.07654318,0.06263084,0.013171005,0.013187081,-0.02723695,-0.009508262,-0.08286318,0.050086603,-0.099542186,-3.3915245e-33,-0.01286411,0.0756357,0.044026326,0.023578702,0.05485144,0.010822234,0.047610424,-0.006808199,0.015701387,-0.016760794,-0.1146304,-0.03896273,0.04623152,0.00021872,-0.051472373,-0.0015992098,0.12152804,-0.080373116,-0.06225571,0.016780557,-0.03503001,-0.08817185,-0.028512955,-0.039538804,0.019536726,0.08139678,-0.06753166,0.003530857,-0.09377662,-0.07644791,-0.04535425,-0.14148663,0.01575778,-0.0061363196,0.020867575,-0.018115375,-0.01812743,0.085059196,0.0104705235,0.0028698246,0.041044015,-0.008808914,-0.026340317,-0.12168173,-0.044727303,0.11384485,-0.004186231,-0.0724543,-0.036825273,0.00881355,0.011379559,0.00242953,-0.055520754,0.00854219,-0.0082106,0.003875657,0.04179658,-0.046589445,-0.04113313,0.050512478,-0.0046731555,-0.024885474,-0.013806841,0.017318282,-0.027664747,0.035027202,0.0016347996,-4.249904e-05,-0.016766438,-0.012800587,-0.066582285,0.04317837,0.04298727,-0.04481433,0.0022172518,-0.007084986,0.0322534,-0.004922743,0.02306785,-0.016999405,0.012793845,-0.03760003,0.020752009,-0.062314987,-0.050001778,-0.062428486,0.0697671,-0.039561007,-0.003282105,0.011615122,0.0047489246,0.033772208,-0.07833902,-0.040223476,0.08561819,-6.379567e-08,-0.04117123,-0.017666657,0.01184811,-0.050968833,0.11507962,0.0053871702,-0.053476714,-0.06813012,0.011231821,-0.059444323,0.030578017,-0.08768158,0.0015534811,0.007632032,-0.045586154,0.010439689,0.014887239,0.058712803,-0.0013155559,-0.04184969,0.013625581,-0.02391943,0.002410278,-0.010610973,0.017630221,0.083084196,-0.023547491,0.009504854,0.06818816,0.032215215,0.006548574,-0.051930364,0.034523785,0.030778866,0.04042657,-0.06486823,-0.0348027,-0.072268054,0.060226124,0.06121395,-0.016909672,0.048699036,-0.07915799,0.04257759,0.11568244,-0.065895125,-0.0001570266,0.024673874,-0.022649774,-0.008210093,0.07606064,-0.010114432,0.037910927,0.040441204,0.01618726,0.01904976,0.023629826,-0.038329095,-0.08413838,-0.04270115,-0.034603372,-0.04075557,-0.10286236,-0.04190433,11,-29.892385,0.20203228,2
524,"in today's session, we covered important data science concepts: regression metrics, sampling distributions, and the central limit theorem (clt). we learned some of the most important regression metrics: sse, mse, rmse, and mae. these metrics assess model performance and prediction accuracy.

we also discussed how regression coefficients from sample data estimate population parameters and the importance of evaluating their reliability. sampling distributions help in this by showing how sample means form a normal distribution, as explained by the clt, enabling population inferences and confidence interval calculations.

finally, we applied these concepts in excel by plotting error histograms and drawing the best-fit line using linear regression, reinforcing their practical relevance in building reliable models.",-0.051589563,-0.07006344,0.005143093,0.018548848,0.076023936,0.017840661,-0.03228076,0.08224243,0.042264692,0.022980256,0.0028458773,-0.023568386,0.043455616,-0.02737192,-0.033318713,-0.04543719,-0.00083716825,-0.06976324,-0.011457021,-0.04581904,0.045969594,0.07578359,-0.046060488,0.009784812,0.02951031,-0.032257173,-0.023566032,-0.057101876,-0.08371575,0.050693274,-0.03787542,0.013580272,0.02487455,0.052070156,-0.057924382,-0.052909717,0.011728345,0.02806776,0.048187133,0.043224465,-0.010715032,0.021784633,0.07556627,0.038105495,0.011677583,-0.0037799198,-0.042533144,-0.067464516,-0.020199822,0.12357159,-0.06431975,-0.026357822,0.026042163,-0.035249215,0.0522524,-0.055478867,-0.044068042,-0.05442308,0.08199375,0.008522511,0.057373103,-0.03960161,-0.074220255,0.049710095,0.047857817,0.0004946452,-0.009021263,0.040681183,-0.02797867,0.01575625,-0.13951315,0.046014126,-0.142622,0.025809418,0.013373497,0.034286138,-0.046199523,0.016453153,0.00555059,-0.040249296,-0.062286906,0.10241101,0.061617587,-0.029678158,0.040603165,0.057523053,0.094759464,0.082443886,-0.017322017,-0.020389827,0.027411385,0.050494462,-0.05403593,0.0722403,-0.059582792,0.09444911,-0.07311319,-0.12245628,0.015292123,0.026994152,0.035898957,0.12269008,0.052539892,-0.020699441,0.04252763,-0.08454678,0.12112449,-0.011563208,0.016945135,-0.0024122377,-0.019810127,0.008041203,0.0010691322,0.0070558866,0.049282283,-0.060102504,-0.056422114,0.05353743,0.0068912124,0.027205007,0.012424477,0.08904079,0.0152718015,-0.02770446,0.008218238,0.030618047,-0.085952885,4.551793e-33,-0.0020581202,-0.00958841,0.041056704,0.026048634,-0.04795437,-0.026393471,-0.1035017,0.013917887,0.048265863,0.047363617,-0.0045169895,-0.024631139,-0.053756576,0.00044734552,0.033344492,0.16087396,-0.022155082,0.07749623,-0.09059725,0.027301515,0.008838087,-0.07530849,0.02412351,-0.018883081,0.0153505895,0.024809768,-0.00091945136,0.10225529,-0.003140073,-0.006406953,0.0120923845,0.099067815,-0.008524938,-0.082838655,0.0023253395,-0.010135246,-0.007284559,-0.04206564,0.0033451046,0.0577584,-0.04341017,0.05942523,0.07799165,0.04858128,-0.00075542054,-0.006820087,0.023214066,-0.0699473,0.01414098,-0.023178646,-0.11393074,-0.02201157,-0.008722086,0.011895235,-0.028523207,0.11347133,-0.020889524,-0.008507811,-0.07653588,0.021417737,-0.0647748,-0.019803187,-0.0068645915,-0.09967893,0.049046278,0.072619595,-0.032980617,0.03305767,0.04880632,0.061771486,0.03832879,-0.07840352,-0.107630245,0.029304156,0.022099975,-0.06411422,0.04680178,-0.0375733,-0.028916797,-0.032744016,0.002084304,-0.029090235,-0.106925994,-0.102413975,0.0052418467,-0.0680251,0.06523024,0.027783008,-0.023285083,-0.06269196,-0.0654881,-0.010577421,-0.040424984,0.00835386,-0.14119112,-5.378815e-33,-0.04662798,0.056959867,0.019013846,0.07196552,0.011168792,-0.03434399,-0.032402113,-0.036866684,0.031932995,-0.050094195,-0.06341554,-0.037497997,0.081569515,0.02274878,0.013322524,0.0035066118,0.018557996,-0.05150273,-0.104944415,-0.06300626,0.025506286,0.017851789,0.031676266,0.0032538567,-0.062460717,0.007637701,-0.14426619,0.056522243,-0.03837591,-0.11879891,0.00039183084,-0.027121572,-0.046015628,-0.026694637,-0.0174297,-0.015737806,0.0323741,0.07588922,0.008751868,0.059320148,0.048971053,0.021454861,-0.021938067,-0.07118678,-0.0027323966,0.031553518,0.08210705,-0.05106952,-0.026527863,0.02210847,-0.004833739,0.026602542,-0.033015423,0.05339835,-0.0042591975,-0.026882777,-0.032221712,-0.021601625,-0.00821092,0.012539819,-0.06540962,0.024202378,-0.009268357,0.05938354,-0.082670346,0.018288897,-0.03674387,0.034439016,0.0025041525,0.06444852,-0.06832558,-0.013227581,0.011442456,0.010177733,-0.04680546,-0.055773005,0.015946642,-0.045277726,0.0019075566,0.046779733,0.046530902,-0.009144853,0.050699405,-0.02596849,0.023871142,-0.015466028,0.092248976,-0.052532054,0.002964096,-0.0020036376,-0.096415736,-0.0033900838,-0.085201636,0.0069471346,-0.03130625,-5.14742e-08,-0.04213292,0.118591174,0.022791494,0.04236009,0.0030320263,0.008046952,-0.01412294,-0.00082503253,-0.061850928,0.026522173,0.051184483,-0.0076655783,-0.05089603,0.027845481,0.038287595,0.046211578,0.04983463,0.09613411,0.0015572691,-0.030665541,-0.046075087,-0.003666093,-0.002569613,0.009416457,0.063944094,-0.008807729,0.041302223,0.12682576,-0.0016419488,0.08741826,0.029594522,-0.0043529533,0.04723088,-0.07709375,0.018465042,0.01654606,-0.028606,-0.038700875,0.095511355,0.03690564,0.04879696,0.058238693,-0.04658667,0.054429743,0.03700771,-0.005880228,0.0852367,0.06265716,-0.029120538,-0.06386803,0.0811975,-0.06479807,0.0069157393,0.05540946,0.048317067,0.003080216,-0.02723217,0.014501666,-0.004837311,-0.0017031513,0.02483035,-0.027984831,0.013996352,-0.0014213828,11,-24.346369,3.3568544,2
541,"in today's class, we begin with a question that we have onlyâ€‚1 sample, e.g., 30 observations, so how do you estimate the population mean based on only 1 sample? is it possible. however,  when errors become predictive thenâ€‚it is not a regression model. not it will take normalâ€‚distribution up to the limit of law => universally at a point whatever the sample could be -> as at some threshold of our samples we will always get their multiple samples normal distribution. if we assume that we have obtained a sample from a population, the first thing we would do is calculate the mean and(assume that this mean is similarâ€‚to the population mean).

standard of deviation of the sampling distribution is population/rootâ€‚under number of observations. in the next step we studied about confidence interval which is actually the areaâ€‚under curve. when we have 95% confidence, auc is 0.95 and the observations lying outside this area areâ€‚0.025 on each side. another interesting point that we also found out was that, if the number of observations isâ€‚less than 30 we do not get normal distribution and the t distribution.

558,"in today's session we talked about core statistical concepts required for machine learning. 
we started our discussion with confidence intervals. what it actually means. we cannot say or predict the trends of population based on a small sample with a 100% confidence hence we use the concepts of confidence intervals to say that we are alpha percent sure that this value will be in this interval. then we talked about upper and lower confidence intervals and two sided interval tests.
also discussed concepts like if the error is taken from population that is the standard deviations of population are followed then it follows a normal distribution and if not then we take standard deviations of sample and it follows a t-distribuion. we also touched upon the concept of p-value. and hypothesis

in  today's session, we focused on key concepts in data science and statistical analysis, including a review of regression metrics, sampling distributions, and the central limit theorem (clt). from the uploaded document, we explored metrics such as sse (sum of squared errors), mse (mean squared error), rmse (root mean squared error), and mae (mean absolute error), which are essential for assessing the performance of linear regression models. these metrics help quantify the model's ability to explain variations in the data and its accuracy in predicting outcomes. the document also introduced the idea that regression coefficients derived from sample data are estimates of population parameters, emphasizing the importance of evaluating their reliability.

to understand this reliability, we examined the concept of sampling distributions, where multiple representative samples are drawn from a population to calculate sample means. these means tend to form a normal distribution as per the central limit theorem, regardless of the original population distribution, provided the sample size is sufficiently large. this principle allows statisticians to infer population characteristics and calculate confidence intervals for model parameters. by reducing uncertainty with larger sample sizes, the standard error of the sampling distribution decreases, improving the precision of estimates. and then we made this on excel sheet and plotted histogram for errors and drew best fit line using linear regression. the discussion highlighted the theoretical and practical importance of these concepts for creating generalizable and reliable models in data science.",-0.051797356,-0.020624446,0.004675598,0.07964993,0.07341714,0.0060022743,-0.043041904,0.10939859,0.06511468,0.02308708,0.0045381957,-0.032908183,0.04642226,-0.03240119,-0.05385324,-0.06265018,-0.001585061,-0.0024809479,-0.031778857,-0.023198433,0.061093032,0.06517823,-0.016452627,0.052251663,0.022167988,-0.0877776,-0.062024895,-0.040379427,-0.08124525,0.08452797,0.0013426981,0.010648521,0.037752487,0.050879426,-0.074531056,-0.038507845,0.024442013,0.04079195,0.03465468,0.05598864,0.009145241,-0.0034144777,0.044714514,0.015754197,0.022547966,-0.017752748,-0.020133393,-0.071976565,-0.030506868,0.12420471,-0.049345724,-0.043166395,0.007177599,-0.06132823,0.038788453,-0.063704915,-0.03305185,-0.044279363,0.062133316,0.010491284,0.05016859,-0.044643957,-0.06317365,0.03687988,0.015052979,0.003911767,-0.020538682,-0.0009974363,-0.02419482,0.01584585,-0.091113426,0.07484971,-0.15317574,0.05967443,0.020991366,-0.023675129,-0.01992,0.044917453,0.01388727,-0.050790872,-0.009529079,0.069291264,0.025427176,-0.047300585,0.0352438,0.024939552,0.08522834,0.06933424,-0.03144279,-0.020104188,0.029241238,0.03302762,-0.05056484,0.07425257,0.005167395,0.08582769,-0.055949863,-0.10268601,0.04436854,0.031502813,0.0107149985,0.10847522,0.048354756,-0.043893367,0.03707568,-0.06674743,0.0695239,-0.062813446,-0.019291202,0.024707016,-0.019586986,0.02548813,-0.048475906,0.05142094,0.031359486,-0.053643037,-0.04427462,0.07975072,0.0091519775,0.034703076,0.04608668,0.07829423,0.03128665,-0.03930622,0.05817622,0.024799148,-0.08459426,4.1245004e-33,0.029860474,-0.0069325403,0.040730007,0.065498866,-0.045185983,-0.036847617,-0.076709926,-0.006208668,0.05088811,0.050582554,0.020274479,-0.072254926,-0.03364983,-0.014070967,0.031703457,0.17735888,-0.014220509,0.07460374,-0.053683486,0.023286754,0.021434363,-0.054928485,0.01807567,-0.004200342,0.006660866,0.026103895,-0.0060576303,0.07540078,-0.0037561492,-0.009449867,-0.016884863,0.041815016,0.021514144,-0.0863265,0.0053439513,0.006517816,0.043425106,-0.022250189,-0.01606488,0.081949554,-0.030611953,0.059178352,0.090745665,0.059000857,0.0042459834,-0.022561328,0.021393133,-0.032998804,-0.0032291468,0.0035472328,-0.106564134,0.03156769,0.0048867064,0.02490849,0.01892183,0.091240585,-0.0404563,0.0044445605,-0.0685574,-0.0058106203,-0.049124803,-0.010550135,-0.0111991335,-0.054143086,0.08545373,0.07088013,-0.03269194,0.0551799,0.014427168,0.03983477,0.03606276,-0.0993463,-0.12102766,0.007979238,-0.0042409054,-0.064058125,0.068226926,-0.028772375,-0.010816255,-0.06830864,0.0030340338,-0.021633202,-0.089112565,-0.09507822,-0.005713364,-0.06711812,0.036103405,0.012931784,0.011460565,-0.084737346,-0.04151913,-0.011411703,-0.04817487,-0.033333085,-0.15888023,-5.0950473e-33,-0.07234143,0.012755098,0.008541056,0.053796522,-0.013400439,-0.04694031,-0.019776316,-0.013596179,-0.009127405,-0.13240087,-0.059542373,-0.046374045,0.09777718,0.0005722115,-0.0009434902,0.015339382,-0.011036341,-0.027020365,-0.08297965,-0.03738627,-0.0035199055,0.005088914,0.071959436,0.014677861,-0.067757696,0.009086305,-0.11575663,0.052211795,-0.027230838,-0.12736918,0.031686883,-0.030092826,-0.062357098,-0.022999369,-0.01367307,-0.023350636,0.050592277,0.07917876,-0.018536381,0.08116931,0.024801755,0.027280733,-0.018952757,-0.07946479,-0.020863548,0.01550327,0.10745042,-0.05042402,-0.022290107,0.017520826,-0.0012040819,-0.012750174,-0.030720893,0.058896083,-0.0033202847,-0.031293884,-0.05404016,-0.013622749,0.03165538,0.007162431,-0.044410072,0.021968473,-0.057561398,0.046219394,-0.07070072,-0.011934996,-0.062515326,0.023054672,0.0062030884,0.09005541,-0.103683986,-0.055871885,0.029133618,-0.01746836,-0.039259765,-0.0256915,-0.0111612575,-0.028546205,0.004952545,0.047505256,0.041346073,0.012131681,0.04823469,-0.057227254,0.0003175952,-0.032626607,0.08828694,-0.030692512,0.0068213763,0.010925345,-0.08780748,-0.015644921,-0.07682227,0.02004886,-0.038554292,-5.8627595e-08,-0.008002213,0.17147249,0.014795325,0.033863064,-0.020526733,-0.026479054,-0.026025673,-0.030510573,-0.083779626,0.011831373,0.043911666,0.006466428,-0.022386396,-0.003411793,0.05341155,0.08121143,0.02089315,0.08368694,0.0022578943,-0.020087665,-0.017421046,-0.0025246418,-0.0015595243,-0.00409596,0.06467355,-0.021819413,0.011843142,0.10599106,-0.01652416,0.0562956,0.031741317,-0.009784393,0.033512942,-0.036234822,0.02933065,-0.022593904,0.0012767938,-0.024416842,0.10975167,0.02544822,0.054744978,0.07045714,-0.07205492,0.073204614,0.06448423,-0.024327947,0.07364848,0.08381055,-0.010925791,-0.058140174,0.05759184,-0.077617794,-0.019731684,0.053345844,0.06302868,0.035379153,-0.013696748,0.01669685,0.012469555,-0.033098184,0.044739038,0.0032422463,0.009219614,-0.0110379,11,-24.24597,3.132686,2
572,"today in class, sir talked about the metrics we use to check how good a linear regression model is, like sse,râ²,etc. he said that when we use tools like excel, many more numbers appear, and to understand them, we need to go back to basic statistics. sir explained that the data we use is just a sample (99 observations in this case), so the values we calculate for the model, like a and b, are only guesses about the real values for the entire population. he said our goal is to create a model that works well for data outside the sample.
sir then explained the idea of sampling distributions and confidence intervals. he said that if we take many small samples from the population and find their means, those means would form a normal distribution, even if the population data isnâ€™t normally distributed. this is called the central limit theorem (clt). he also said that bigger samples give more accurate results, while smaller samples create more uncertainty. sir explained that this normal distribution helps us make good guesses about the population, even when we donâ€™t know everything about

error matrics that can be calculated are mse, rmse, sse, mae.
sst is measure of total variation in given dataset. sse is variations not explained by model, they are attributed to random errors. ssr is total variation explained by lr model. sst = sse + ssr.
a good model is the model that explains most of the variations in the data.

653,"we discussed and looked into the various numbers of statistics that come out from a standard process. there is p value which state how close close is our estimate and the it also tells us about the confidence of our estimate. and for that we use a interval as a point has a zero probability, but an interval can have a probability with the setting that the area under the distribution is kept at 1 and ratio can be used and appropriate values can be found. we also looked at the t-stat distribution. it is like normal but a bit more spread out at the extremes and flat at the mean.

658,"we started with the revision of some concepts from the previous class, whereby we had discussed about the sampling distribution of the sample mean. today we defined some new terms with regards to that histogram. we defined the standard deviation of the sampling distribution or the standard error s_x_bar, which is equal to the population standard deviation upon the square root of the number of observation in the sample. today's discussion revolved around the idea that we might not have a lot of samples for each and every data. we may have only one sample in some cases. in that case, how can we make predictions or analyse the parameters of the population, using the statistics of the given sample. one highlight point is that the sampling distribution is always normally distributed i.e. it has a normal distribution which can be expressed as n(mu, sigma), where mu is the population mean and sigma is the population standard deviation. suppose we have only one sample. we can find the mean of all the observations in this sample and assume that it is the mean of the population. then we can also calculate the standard deviation of our sample and we again assume that it is the standard deviation of the population. both these assumptions rely on the fact that ideally, a sample should be a good representation of the population. then we get both mu and sigma for the sampling distribution and since it is normally distributed, we get the distribution as well. now we can calculate the boundary points of the area of 95% confidence level. we also studied that the area under the normal distribution curve, is actually the probability that the mean of the sample lies in that range. hence, we can get two boundary points, within which the area under the curve is 0.95. we also divide our frequency of sample means by the total number of means, so that our graph is normalised and we directly get the probabilities from the area under the curve. the total area under the curve is 1. 
we went on to say that if our no. of observations in the sample are less than 30, then we get a t distribution instead of normal distribution. hence, we understood the terms lower 95% and upper 95%. we also talked about p value, which is basically 2 times the area under the distribution curve beyond the point where our regression coefficient lies. we said that the lower the p value, the better is our regression model.
